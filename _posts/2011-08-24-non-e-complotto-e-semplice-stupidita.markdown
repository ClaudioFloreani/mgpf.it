Ho trovato qualcun altro che la pensa come me:

> “When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” *([Steve Jobs](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) intervista a WIRED magazine February 1996)*  
  
Sconvolgente, eh... E l'[intera intervista](http://ifindkarma.typepad.com/relax/2004/11/ultimately_it_c.html) è ancora più interessante della singola citazione.  
E penso esattamente la stessa cosa da anni.
