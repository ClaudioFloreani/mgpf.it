> "Italy is actually a country with lot of talented human resources, who often unfortunately decide to move abroad to have better opportunities.  
> The country has lot of positive forces in technology but it does not have yet a startup ecosystem able to give support to entrepreneurs and innovating companies. This is mostly due to the high level of incompetency of our political class that ignores completely the digital economy even if it is growing at a pace of 10% per year while the rest of the economy is nearly in recession"
