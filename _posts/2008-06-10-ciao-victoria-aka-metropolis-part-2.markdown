Se passate da Via Numa Pompilio stasera e sentite qualcuno che canta a squarciagola di Dream Theatre sono io. E se ho gli occhi pieni di lacrime non preoccupatevi: è normale.

Where did we come from?  
Why are we here?  
Where do we go when we die?  
What lies beyond?  
And what lay before?  
Is anything certain in life?  
  
They say, Life is too short,  
The here and the now  
And Youre only given one shot  
But could there be more,  
Have I lived before,  
Or could this be all that weve got?  
  
If I die tomorrow  
Id be allright  
Because I believe  
That after were gone  
The spirit carries on  
  
I used to be frightened of dying  
I used to think death was the end  
But that was before  
Im not scared anymore  
I know that my soul will transcend  
  
I may never find all the answers  
I may never understand why  
I may never prove  
What I know to be true  
But I know that I still have to try  
  
If I die tomorrow  
Id be all right  
Because I believe  
That after were gone  
The spirit carries on  
**"Open your eyes, Nicholas.**  
**"AAAH!**
