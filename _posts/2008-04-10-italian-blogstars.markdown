The **Italian Blogstars** Linkedin Groups represent the will for networking bloggers from around Italy.  
It was born out of necessity, with more than one hundred bloggers talking toogether and animately discussing and sharing business-cards and contacts.   
  
Entry to the group is **sponsor-based**: two members of the group must **vouch for the newcomer** and members can contact each other directly to talk, discuss or even having business toogether.  
  
For other info please review the **LinkedIn Group Page** (pending)
