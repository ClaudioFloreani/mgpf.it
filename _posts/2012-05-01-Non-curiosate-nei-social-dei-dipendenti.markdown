> A new bill introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives would make it illegal for employers and other institutions to require Social Media passwords from their employees. The bill, the Social Networking Online Protection Act (SNOPA), would protect current and prospective employees as well as individuals facing disciplinary action against schools, universities, and employers that would otherwise require them to provide user names, passwords, or other access to online content.
