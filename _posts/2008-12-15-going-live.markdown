<p>It&#8217;s much more difficult than I supposed to be in the first place :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fooldns.com">FoolDns</a> Staff and service is at its full power and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">Documentation</a> for <a href="http://www.fooldns.com">FoolDns</a> Business is almosty there. Pricing plans are OK and soon enough we&#8217;ll be able to offer the paid plan.</p>
<p>The only difficult thing is to find out people: there could be a crisis going on, but no one seem to be effected right now! We&#8217;re <a href="http://thefool.it/jobs/">hiring</a> <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> programmers, DHTML/CSS/JS designers and a Marketing man but nothing seem to appear at the end of each day.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not be frustrated and let&#8217;s go on: and if you think you can fit in any of the jobs descriptions be welcome!</p>
