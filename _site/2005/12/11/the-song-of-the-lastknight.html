<p>##by Stefano Lodi</p>
<h1 id="part-i--the-rising-of-a-myth">Part I- The Rising of a Myth</h1>
<p>Henceforth I sing of The Last Knight, who stands</p>
<p>to fight all forms of evil with his great</p>
<p>unbounded strength, and of his many friends,</p>
<p>and of what made him King, a head of state,</p>
<p>and of his courage pure, which never ends,</p>
<p>and of the things he did when passionate,</p>
<p>as Love was burning him. Please pay attention,</p>
<p>were entering a wonderful dimension&hellip;</p>
<p>O Lord, all we</p>
<p>are thanking thee:         10</p>
<p>You made a Knight</p>
<p>who brings Your light.</p>
<p>The evil force</p>
<p>hell face; a horse</p>
<p>hell have, and bright</p>
<p>will shine his might.</p>
<p>He has no name,</p>
<p>but Evils flame</p>
<p>hell win in fight</p>
<p>and stop our fright.         20</p>
<p>Hell be the Last,</p>
<p>the Man, the Best:</p>
<p>hell know whats right,</p>
<p>hell win this night.</p>
<p>I hear this song, its coming from the towers</p>
<p>and walls where live the ones who keep the powers.</p>
<p>I hear it sung by poor and rich and humble,</p>
<p>it is so strong I think the walls might crumble.</p>
<p>Whats happening in the castle? Tell me, please!</p>
<p>A man is rising, that our pains will ease.    30</p>
<p>Hes young and strong and wise and full of pride.</p>
<p>The Queen is giving him a horse to ride,</p>
<p>a sword to kill, a name: hell be a Knight.</p>
<p>Outside the castle songs were heard till night.</p>
<p>Lets see what was befalling in the halls.</p>
<p>The Queen did say: You know that Glory calls</p>
<p>just few among the men who serve the king,</p>
<p>and for the chosen ones there is a ring.</p>
<p>The King had left to kill the Dragon Red:</p>
<p>the Beast has widowed me, the King is dead.    40</p>
<p>His Knights preceded him, though filled with fear;</p>
<p>theyve all been slain, their rings were taken here.</p>
<p>The Dragon Evil sits upon a hill:</p>
<p>we need a Knight, the Dragon Fierce to kill.</p>
<p>Nobody has the courage to uphold</p>
<p>a sword and by an armour be enfold.</p>
<p>But now a man has risen from the land</p>
<p>and he is here, you now will see him stand.</p>
<p>Arise and leave your seat and come to me.</p>
<p>My dearest Queen, you know that I will be    50</p>
<p>your Knight, if this you want; so now I kneel</p>
<p>before your feet, and kiss your golden seal.</p>
<p>O pages, bring to me the Holy Sword,</p>
<p>and he will be a Knight before our Lord.</p>
<p>The Holy Sword was brought: it shone and glared</p>
<p>and everybody at its brightness stared.</p>
<p>It was engraved with holy symbols, made</p>
<p>of gold and diamonds; steely was its blade.</p>
<p>The prophets told about this day, you know,</p>
<p>and legends probably from you will grow.     60</p>
<p>I think, my Queen, that great will be my deeds,</p>
<p>but theyre so hard: I know that all the seeds</p>
<p>will never grow until the Dragons slain,</p>
<p>and I must bring this land to life again.</p>
<p>I am the chosen one, I am the Last</p>
<p>of many Knights, all fallen in the past.</p>
<p>I have the hardest mission to fulfil:</p>
<p>the red and burning blood I have to spill</p>
<p>that runs inside the Dragons veins and heart.</p>
<p>I have to win or we will have no part     70</p>
<p>in future days, because well live no more.</p>
<p>You say the truth: well live just for your core.</p>
<p>Then why we talk? We waste our time and wait!</p>
<p>Declare I am a Knight, Ill face my Fate.</p>
<p>And so this be. I take the Sword and lay</p>
<p>its blade upon your shoulders strong and say</p>
<p>that you from now must call yourself a Knight.</p>
<p>The Holy Sword was glistening of light.</p>
<p>It warm was felt by him, the Knight just born:</p>
<p>he felt its power, heard the bell and horn    80</p>
<p>of Heaven playing for him and then he knew</p>
<p>that he had hopes to win the Beast, but few.</p>
<p>The Queen now said: The Holy Sword youll keep</p>
<p>until the Dragon from this land you sweep;</p>
<p>and then it will be taken from your hand</p>
<p>and you will have it only to defend</p>
<p>this castle, kingdom, people and this Queen</p>
<p>who made you Knight, as now we all have seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for the fight and proud to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, the Holy Sword and ring I give    90</p>
<p>to you. This ring was once on great a finger:</p>
<p>the strongest of the Knights has been its bringer.</p>
<p>It is for you, who stand alone and ride,</p>
<p>alone; the Holy Sword is by your side.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll leave tomorrow. Now, relax and rest:</p>
<p>I offer you this castle, be my guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Queen; accepting, I am glad;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat your tasty meal and go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The court went happily to long a table,</p>
<p>with food on it so good that Im not able     100</p>
<p>to tell, because I feel by hunger bit.</p>
<p>Lets celebrate this glorious day! Lets sit</p>
<p>and honour all the castlemen that cook!</p>
<p>The Knight sat down, and chickens first he took,</p>
<p>then wine, and every man began to eat.</p>
<p>How strong and sweet this wine, how good this meat!</p>
<p>A song arose from all the sitting men.</p>
<p>You want to read it? I will write it, then.</p>
<p>We have a Knight who shows the Sun,</p>
<p>he is the last, the only one       110</p>
<p>who can defeat the Dragon, cruel,</p>
<p>who can defeat It in a duel.</p>
<p>Our Kingdoms greatly suffering</p>
<p>for all the flames the Dragon lights.</p>
<p>It killed all those who wore a ring:</p>
<p>the King himself with all his knights.</p>
<p>We dont know how, we dont know why,</p>
<p>but It has chosen this sweet land:</p>
<p>a demon, fallen from the sky;</p>
<p>before the Beast no one can stand.      120</p>
<p>The Queen, alone, was forced to choose</p>
<p>among her subjects one that could</p>
<p>defeat the Dragon, never lose</p>
<p>control and split the Beast like wood.</p>
<p>She sent her messengers around,</p>
<p>they walked and knocked at every door,</p>
<p>and now the Warrior has been found:</p>
<p>we have new Hope, we fear no more.
The prophets said there would have been</p>
<p>a man, a Knight, that signs would show;     130</p>
<p>as this was known, a path was seen</p>
<p>that led them through the deepest snow</p>
<p>and then the meadows and a river;</p>
<p>but, after walking, they did find</p>
<p>the Chosen by our Lord Forgiver,</p>
<p>the Man whod never stay behind.</p>
<p>We have a Knight: he shows the Sun,</p>
<p>he is the Last, the Man, the One</p>
<p>who will defeat the Dragon, cruel,</p>
<p>who must defeat It in a duel.      140</p>
<p>Oh, dear. Who wrote these lyrics? I did write.</p>
<p>A man, so thin and tall, whose skin was white,</p>
<p>stood up. His hair was long and green his eyes.</p>
<p>I am the one to celebrate your rise.</p>
<p>All right, but tell me: how shall I call you?</p>
<p>A Poet you can say, this name is true.</p>
<p>I am a bard, I have the greatest gift:</p>
<p>I write my verses, words that make me lift</p>
<p>my soul above the common world and life.</p>
<p>But I am sad: Id like to have a wife.     150</p>
<p>O Poet, to the eyes you seem so young,</p>
<p>but words of wisdom exeunt from your tongue,</p>
<p>and I would like to know you as a friend.</p>
<p>I liked your words. I offer you this hand.</p>
<p>All right. You are my friend. Ill write your name,</p>
<p>to be eternal, on the Book of Fame.</p>
<p>You say youll take me to Eternity?</p>
<p>I say that both of us will never see,</p>
<p>inside the hearts of men, a Death complete.</p>
<p>Lets stop or, hungry, you might face defeat!    160</p>
<p>The songs went on till night began to creep</p>
<p>around and put the comrades all to sleep.</p>
<p>The Knight did sleep, and with the Sun he rose.</p>
<p>He saw that on his window was a rose.</p>
<p>O flower, tender, delicate and sweet,</p>
<p>a victory or Death: what will I meet?</p>
<p>He sniffed the rose and felt a good sensation:</p>
<p>he was the hand of Him who made Creation.</p>
<p>His hair was fair; he stared at where the air</p>
<p>was golden made by sunshine as his hair.     170</p>
<p>O Lord Almighty, lead me, be my guide.</p>
<p>I cannot lose, or I would have to hide</p>
<p>from all the men and die to clear my sin.</p>
<p>I pray, because I simply have to win.</p>
<p>I know Ill face so many risks, but still</p>
<p>I have the hope to find the strength to kill</p>
<p>the Dragon, Beast that must have come from Hell.</p>
<p>Ill take revenge for all the knights who fell.</p>
<p>He waited there till all awoke that morning.</p>
<p>Were in your hands. Avoid another mourning!    180</p>
<p>The Holy Sword is ready for the battle.</p>
<p>Ill shake the Dragons bones, youll hear them rattle.</p>
<p>I dont know how, o Knight, you can be sure</p>
<p>that you will triumph. Well, my soul is pure,</p>
<p>my heart is beating hard, my mind is clear;</p>
<p>the time of victory is coming near.</p>
<p>I need a horse to reach the battlefield,</p>
<p>an armour, too; with it, a silver shield.</p>
<p>O servants, bring the armour and be quick!</p>
<p>The Dragons burning blood I want to lick!    190</p>
<p>A storm is coming; I foresee this scene:</p>
<p>hell fail to face the sight of eyes as green</p>
<p>as emeralds, that shine inside your face.</p>
<p>Youll risk your life for all the human race.</p>
<p>The Knight and Queen went there where horses stay.</p>
<p>The time has come of Dragons Judgement Day!</p>
<p>Dont lose your mind, from which you must remove</p>
<p>all signs of fear and every will to move</p>
<p>too fast. Remember, he can spit the flame!</p>
<p>Dont worry, I can cover It with shame!     200</p>
<p>The horse was ready and he mounted it.</p>
<p>Remember that you must not lose your wit!</p>
<p>Dont worry, Queen; but wheres my armour strong?</p>
<p>Its coming! All the prophets cant be wrong.</p>
<p>They said there is a man whos strong enough</p>
<p>to win, resistant, merciless and tough.</p>
<p>I am this man, of all the Knights the Last.</p>
<p>Nobody can be better, Im the best.</p>
<p>O mighty Knight, the shield has come for you!</p>
<p>He saw the shield, that painted was in blue.    210</p>
<p>It showed a picture of an ancient war</p>
<p>and said in gold: We live just for your core.</p>
<p>Whats this? For you this silver shield was made.</p>
<p>It shows our gratitude that cannot fade.</p>
<p>Oh, well, it is so beautiful, I feel</p>
<p>that I will kill the Dragon with my steel.</p>
<p>Its colour is the colour of the sky,</p>
<p>where birds and angels live and sing and fly.</p>
<p>And now the armour comes that you will wear.</p>
<p>Ill be protected perfectly out there.     220</p>
<p>The Dragons blood will spill as does a fountain.</p>
<p>I feel so strong that I could break a mountain!</p>
<p>Im ready for the moment of attack.</p>
<p>Ill win the fight and never turn my back.</p>
<p>Ill pray, my Knight, Ill pray for your return.</p>
<p>I hope that all the Dragons flames wont burn.</p>
<p>This armour can defend you from the heat.</p>
<p>The Dragons heart for me will stop its beat.</p>
<p>You leave, the time to ride your horse is this.</p>
<p>To show affection, let me give a kiss     230</p>
<p>to you who leave your house. If this you seek.</p>
<p>Be quick, I have to reach the Dragons peak.</p>
<p>I hope that this will bring you luck and heal</p>
<p>your wounds and what is right to do reveal.</p>
<p>She touched him gently with her tender lips.</p>
<p>And so I leave to kill the Beast that rips</p>
<p>the heart of she who rules, who kissed my cheek</p>
<p>so kindly that has made me feel so weak</p>
<p>that now I cannot say a single word</p>
<p>or raise a final prayer to my Lord.      240</p>
<p>I shut my mouth and leave. My Queen, farewell.</p>
<p>My mission is to stop this Beast of Hell.</p>
<p>The horse was called «Destroyer». It was black,</p>
<p>of fierce and strength and power had no lack.</p>
<p>They rode together to the place where graves</p>
<p>were dug for those the Dragon made its slaves.</p>
<p>The King was there, the man who had the crown:</p>
<p>he had been killed, in Dragons flames did drown.</p>
<p>The Knight went on and passed through morning dew</p>
<p>and fog. A noise he heard, his Sword he drew:    250</p>
<p>it was a peasant. He did ask to him:</p>
<p>Who are you, Knight, with sad a face and grim?</p>
<p>I am the one wholl save this kingdom, good.</p>
<p>I thought you were the one who steals my food.</p>
<p>You are the Knight, I heard of you, Im sorry.</p>
<p>It does not matter, peasant good. Dont worry.</p>
<p>He thought: Im even known among the poor!</p>
<p>«Destroyer» went on riding through the moor.</p>
<p>The Knight rode on for seven nights and days;</p>
<p>the Sun did throw to him its many rays     260</p>
<p>and then a Lady shone, shes called the Moon;</p>
<p>she said the final hour would come soon.</p>
<p>The Knight with all his heart told God a prayer:</p>
<p>My Lord, you save me from the Dragon slayer</p>
<p>or Ill return to where a Life begins,</p>
<p>to You, if You forgive me all my sins.</p>
<p>Or I will go to Hell and suffer there;</p>
<p>but still I hope to close the Dragons lair.</p>
<p>He was afraid of Death, his enemy</p>
<p>was just his fear of what he was to see.     270</p>
<p>He came to where the Dragon Evil slept;</p>
<p>It woke and moved, to leave its lair It crept.</p>
<p>Who is the man who thinks to be so proud</p>
<p>to win my force? the Dragon cried out loud.</p>
<p>I am the Knight wholl show you what is Death.</p>
<p>I followed with this mighty horse the path</p>
<p>that led to you, o Dragon with two wings.</p>
<p>Your weapon is a toy, it simply stings!</p>
<p>You are a demon, you have brought us sorrow</p>
<p>and pain; youll never see the sun tomorrow!    280</p>
<p>An angel took control of every mind,</p>
<p>the way to stop their fight he made them find.</p>
<p>Im not a beast, by Nature I was done!</p>
<p>You lie! You cannot be our Fathers son!</p>
<p>I am. I came from distant places and</p>
<p>I sat down here; I saw some people stand</p>
<p>aggressive, thus I felt I could have died;</p>
<p>I simply have defended all my side.</p>
<p>You say Im wrong, so tell me wheres my fault!</p>
<p>A King with al his Knights did once assault,    290</p>
<p>you know theyre dead; what ever could I do?</p>
<p>I stop, I give the right to speak to you.</p>
<p>Oh, well, but what are you? I understood</p>
<p>that youre an enemy, not something good,</p>
<p>by what I had been told: but now I know</p>
<p>you tell the truth. Away my sword I throw.</p>
<p>I know you could have burnt me, Dragon, but</p>
<p>you didnt: the door that led to war is shut.</p>
<p>But why you tell this things to me just now?</p>
<p>The King and all his Knights could not allow    300</p>
<p>a Dragon, me, to speak; but they had not</p>
<p>the Holy Sword that you, my friend, have brought.</p>
<p>It made me feel secure, and thus I spoke.</p>
<p>Ill never turn yourself, with flames, to smoke.</p>
<p>I cant believe whats happening in this time!</p>
<p>If I killed you, this deed would be a crime!</p>
<p>I feel a higher, holy, mighty force</p>
<p>has kept me far away from this remorse.</p>
<p>And I have felt the same, as if a saint</p>
<p>has saved me, too; I think Im going to faint!    310</p>
<p>Oh, well, you have to be astonished, reader,</p>
<p>but I dont know the plans of God, our Leader.</p>
<p>I cannot know the future of this story,</p>
<p>but I am sure the Knight will find much glory.</p>
<p>O Dragon, would you like to wear my saddle?</p>
<p>You say the truth? Of joy my bones all rattle!</p>
<p>Im glad to be the animal you ride,</p>
<p>o Knight that keeps the Right and True inside.</p>
<p>The Knight then set his horse Destroyer free,</p>
<p>who ran away, like leaves blown from a tree.    320</p>
<p>O Dragon, we can say from now were brothers!</p>
<p>Well never care of what is said by others.</p>
<p>And now lets fly to where my ride began!</p>
<p>Im shedding skin! I come to life again!</p>
<p>The Dragons skin was red and turned to gold!</p>
<p>You change! A miracle Ive just behold!</p>
<p>It was the sign the Dragond turned to good.</p>
<p>It spread its wings and flied on every wood</p>
<p>and river; he was driven by the one</p>
<p>who had to win, but then they both had won!    330</p>
<p>No blood was spilled, the mission was fulfilled;</p>
<p>and both their hearts still pulsed, no one was killed.</p>
<p>The Knight was proud of riding through the sky;</p>
<p>he felt that he from then would never die.</p>
<p>Lets say the things that happened to the Queen!</p>
<p>The Sun is shining bright, the grass is green!</p>
<p>The people all are happy, what can break</p>
<p>this day of joy and mirth, with no mistake?</p>
<h1 id="part-ii--the-tragedies-of-power">Part II  The Tragedies of Power</h1>
<p>The guards upon the towers looked at him</p>
<p>returning with the Dragon tamed, not grim.    340</p>
<p>The Knight is back! He rides the Dragon! He</p>
<p>has won! From Evil we have been set free!</p>
<p>He made the Dragon, winged and golden, land.</p>
<p>Im back! This is my home, my mother land.</p>
<p>The Knight, expecting feasts, did pass the walls,</p>
<p>but there for him was nothing. What befalls?</p>
<p>He heard a voice: The Queen is sick, shes dying!</p>
<p>He thought: A madman speaks. He must be lying.</p>
<p>But then he saw that every face was sad</p>
<p>and dim and pale, as if someone was dead.     350</p>
<p>Its true, my Knight. The Queen is very sick.</p>
<p>Im here to take you to her rooms. Be quick!</p>
<p>This horse is yours. Your name I want to know!</p>
<p>Im Captain Strator. White was he, like snow.</p>
<p>They rode together quickly to the Queen.</p>
<p>The clouds were covering the Suns bright sheen.</p>
<p>The servants let the Knight come in. He ran</p>
<p>much faster than a common, normal man.</p>
<p>The Queen was lying in bed. My Knight, are you&hellip;?</p>
<p>Im back! Im suffering! I suffer, too!    360</p>
<p>Im like a rose: I shine one day, then wither.</p>
<p>I have no trunk, my stalk is thin and lither.</p>
<p>Im leaving life because of a disease.</p>
<p>My heartbeats soon are going to stop, to cease.</p>
<p>Is there no cure? There are no hopes for me.</p>
<p>Before my nobles, here I state: youll be&hellip;</p>
<p>the King. This land is yours. Dont say a word.</p>
<p>Respect my choice. My soul is now a bird,</p>
<p>its free to fly to Heaven. Let me die.</p>
<p>The sceptre you must hold, and on the throne    370</p>
<p>youll sit. But now I leave this world alone.</p>
<p>She breathed her last breath. My Queen, goodbye.</p>
<p>The Queen had chosen her sepulchre; let</p>
<p>her body rest and be by tears made wet.</p>
<p>I order this. And mourning in the nation</p>
<p>will last three days. Lets pray for her salvation.</p>
<p>A tune of Death be written, that well sing.</p>
<p>Thats all. These are the orders of the King.</p>
<p>The bards&hellip; the Poet: call him , make him write.</p>
<p>He poured his weeping ink on paper white.     380</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -</p>
<p>The Queen has left from life,</p>
<p>shes stopped the endless strife,</p>
<p>a widow was, and wife,</p>
<p>and cries of pain are spread.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -
O Death, you took the Queen!</p>
<p>The grass, it wont be green       390</p>
<p>in spring; a squalid scene</p>
<p>well see, becoming mad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -</p>
<p>Her subjects felt her need.</p>
<p>With her, the weakest seed</p>
<p>had chance to grow. We bleed,</p>
<p>and soon well have no bread.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -       400</p>
<p>The Queen, o Death, you took!</p>
<p>A sage, his head he shook.</p>
<p>Shell live inside the book</p>
<p>of History, he said.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -</p>
<p>The happy voices die</p>
<p>and even from the sky</p>
<p>the angels seem to cry:</p>
<p>I see them in my head.        410</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -</p>
<p>You took the Queen, o Death!</p>
<p>Her time has come. She hath</p>
<p>exhaled her latest breath,</p>
<p>the last; from her has fled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -
The Queen is dead, but when</p>
<p>shell come and rule again,       420</p>
<p>this ballad every man</p>
<p>will sing and hell be glad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We cry: the Queen is dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World itself is sad. -</p>
<p>I want to know -of pain I must get rid-</p>
<p>the mates Im going to spend my living with.</p>
<p>The lords were six: with him, they all were seven;</p>
<p>and twelve the ladies; all were sent by Heaven.</p>
<p>O Knight, the Queen has chosen you as King,</p>
<p>youll win this deadly winter with your spring.   430</p>
<p>You are my counsellors, we rule together.</p>
<p>Well face the future as we face the weather:</p>
<p>we cannot know whats going to happen, nor</p>
<p>we see the principles were living for.</p>
<p>We still can pray for God, you too, my mate;</p>
<p>we all can hope to face a prosper fate.</p>
<p>We have not any sign of future yet;</p>
<p>the stars are going to shine on us, I bet!</p>
<p>I share with you, companions, all my hope;</p>
<p>I think that future hides a downward slope.    440</p>
<p>I see you rather optimistic, sire;</p>
<p>but now, like ducks, we slobber in the mire.</p>
<p>The kingdom must be held, we cannot lose</p>
<p>control; I fear your subjects will accuse</p>
<p>his Majesty of stealing throne and crown.</p>
<p>The moral in the guards is falling down.</p>
<p>We risk rebellion, riot, revolution</p>
<p>and you might lose your head in execution!</p>
<p>Dont worry that so much! I have no fear:</p>
<p>the spirit of the Queen is always near.     450</p>
<p>The spirits cannot show and talk to us,</p>
<p>we cant control this way the lower class.</p>
<p>Im sure the guards will never leave their duty.</p>
<p>The Queen has gone away with all her beauty,</p>
<p>she told me to be king: you saw the fact.</p>
<p>We wont tell now the truth, for less impact.</p>
<p>We must prepare the ground. No one should speak.</p>
<p>Well keep this secret till your fear is weak.</p>
<p>Youre right, my king. It seems the correct choice.</p>
<p>From everybody here will come no voice.     460</p>
<p>And so they did. A funeral was set</p>
<p>and all the faces were by tears made wet.</p>
<p>The seven held the power in the reign,</p>
<p>they stood like mountains beaten by the rain.</p>
<p>The kingdom was in perfect law and order,</p>
<p>but sounds of war were coming from the border.</p>
<p>A neighbour kingdom was aggressive, fierce;</p>
<p>its troops were trained through lines of foes to pierce.</p>
<p>The King, one day, decided to prepare</p>
<p>for war: he made new swords and armours glare.    470</p>
<p>He called his captains. Soon this peace will stop.</p>
<p>The scythe will mow my men instead of crop.</p>
<p>Another form of evil is aggressive:</p>
<p>the number of the foes is so impressive.</p>
<p>We must prepare for war against this rival.</p>
<p>You soldiers have to grant us all survival.</p>
<p>You know the situation we must face.</p>
<p>I want to lead the troops, to set the pace.</p>
<p>The news is bad: the enemies are close,</p>
<p>the smell of war is coming to my nose.     480</p>
<p>I ask you, captains: are my soldiers ready?</p>
<p>Your men are tough; theyll stand as mountains steady.</p>
<p>All right. The Dragon, he will take me to the skies.</p>
<p>He certainly will be a great surprise!</p>
<p>Tonight I saw this battle in a vision:</p>
<p>a victory. Ive taken the decision</p>
<p>to go to war with signs of sure success!</p>
<p>We must not feel the sign of any stress.</p>
<p>Well go tomorrow to the battlefield.</p>
<p>We go to win. The enemies must yield.     490</p>
<p>The morning after, they began to move.</p>
<p>Their courage and their skills they were to prove.</p>
<p>Before the night descended, they set up</p>
<p>the tents inside the camp. Of wine a cup</p>
<p>they rose to Victory: a toast they made,</p>
<p>as Night was hiding everything in shade.</p>
<p>They saw the foes extinguishing their fire.</p>
<p>The battle everybody did desire.</p>
<p>They went to sleep. The King that night did dream:</p>
<p>he saw the Dragon drowning in a stream,     500</p>
<p>which took him to a gloomy, roaring well.</p>
<p>The Dragon was with him, but hidden well.</p>
<p>The King woke up in fright, no more he slept</p>
<p>but then the fear of Death away he swept.</p>
<p>The morning after showed the Sun as red</p>
<p>as blood, with which the ground would soon be fed.</p>
<p>The sky was clear, there was no sign of cloud.</p>
<p>The soldiers were prepared, they were so proud.</p>
<p>The enemies were ready with their maces.</p>
<p>Well clear that smile appearing on your faces!   510</p>
<p>The trumpets on both sides did sound the charge.</p>
<p>The army of the foes was very large.</p>
<p>The weapons and the armours met with clash,</p>
<p>as if the Moon into the Sun did smash.</p>
<p>The King then ordered: Set my Dragon free!</p>
<p>The Dragon spread his wings, the foes did flee.</p>
<p>The King himself impended with his shape.</p>
<p>The foes were burnt, nobody could escape.</p>
<p>But then the sky turned dead and cold and black,</p>
<p>from many clouds came down a noisy crack.     520</p>
<p>The King and Dragon, targets of a lightning,</p>
<p>were hit: the scene the soldiers saw was frightening.</p>
<p>The foes were strengthened, seeing the Dragon fall;</p>
<p>a wizard, one among the foes, did call</p>
<p>the heavy tempest that was taking form;</p>
<p>A terrible surprise for us, this storm!</p>
<p>The Dragon was my secret weapon, while</p>
<p>the foes did hide a storm: I feel fragile.</p>
<p>The King was still alive: thats what he thought.</p>
<p>By whom to lead a war I have been brought?    530</p>
<p>By me. Ive taken all my men to slaughter.</p>
<p>Ill die without an heir, a son or daughter.</p>
<p>You cannot die, my King: the Dragon spoke.</p>
<p>His wings, still moving, rose a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>Lets fly back home! Today, we must surrender!</p>
<p>The correct choice is this, my good commander.</p>
<p>Youre right. I have to order the retreat,</p>
<p>or I would have to face defeat complete.</p>
<p>He flied again and shouted: Quick, retire!</p>
<p>Defeat is not a thing to which aspire!     540</p>
<p>The soldiers, luckily, were not in slumber;</p>
<p>they hastened back, with their decreasing number.</p>
<p>They were one half of what theyd been before.</p>
<p>Where was today the God that we adore?</p>
<p>Too many have been killed, too many died;</p>
<p>a lot of them was looking for a bride.</p>
<p>Perhaps in Heaven they will find some joy.</p>
<p>Shut up! I know, I hoped we could destroy</p>
<p>the enemy today, but I was shocked</p>
<p>by seeing their storm: my senses all were blocked   550</p>
<p>by terror. Now, my courage I can find.</p>
<p>A plan is taking form inside my mind.</p>
<p>Inside the foemens camp I want to creep</p>
<p>and stop the wizard that my men did sweep.</p>
<p>A good idea, my King! You show no fright!</p>
<p>I dont deserve that name, so call me Knight.</p>
<p>My Knight, if thus you want, the problems double:</p>
<p>their leader is another cause of trouble.</p>
<p>You have to kill them both. But tell me: why?</p>
<p>I want them to retire, not to die!      560</p>
<p>My kingdom must uphold the flag of peace.</p>
<p>The tree of human kind, of it theyre piece.</p>
<p>I have no right to slay another man.</p>
<p>Shut up and listen, please: I have a plan.</p>
<p>My wizards have prepared for me a potion:</p>
<p>when someone drinks of it, he has no motion</p>
<p>for many days. This fact is not outrageous</p>
<p>as Death itself, but I must be courageous.</p>
<p>Disguised in black, Ill run across the meadows</p>
<p>before their field, protected by the shadows    570</p>
<p>of Night: Ill be invisible. I swear</p>
<p>Ill do it, on the name of Knight I bear.</p>
<p>My Knight, I think you are a bit insane.</p>
<p>A human life I want to not profane.</p>
<p>But this is war! Some people have to die!</p>
<p>Youre wrong! I want an answer, captain: why?</p>
<p>Because in every war some blood is shed!</p>
<p>But wars are always wrong. My blood is red</p>
<p>and flowing: life is right. But war exists&hellip;</p>
<p>It does not matter: hands must not be fists.    580</p>
<p>This life that runs aways our greatest gift.</p>
<p>You make me think my thoughts on life should shift.</p>
<p>You have to go, my Knight, and let the stars</p>
<p>enlighten you and heal of war the scars.</p>
<p>The Knight put on his cloak and leather boots,</p>
<p>then moved. A sudden noise: he cracked some roots.</p>
<p>I must make well my steps. He lit a lamp</p>
<p>which sent a feeble light, and left his camp.</p>
<p>The guards saluted him. He went out running.</p>
<p>I cannot run: I have to be more cunning.    590</p>
<p>His heart was beating strong and very fast.</p>
<p>Of all the Knights, I am the best, the last.</p>
<p>He had to find his courage in his soul.</p>
<p>With pride and strength enough I am the sole.</p>
<p>I must complete this mission. O my Lord,</p>
<p>I ask you for a good, comforting word.</p>
<p>I pray, just give to me a little sign.</p>
<p>Defeat of Victory: what will be mine?</p>
<p>He saw a little comet fall and glare.</p>
<p>A word of praise is coming from the air!     600</p>
<p>I thank you, Father! You have heard my call.</p>
<p>I feel You by my side: I cannot fall.</p>
<p>He moved. As he was looking for an entry,</p>
<p>he tried to find a place without a sentry.</p>
<p>I cannot find a breach in their protection.</p>
<p>They might have even powers of detection.</p>
<p>He wanted to get back, but every guard</p>
<p>did move at once. A song&hellip; it is the Bard!</p>
<p>My friend has followed me! He must be crazy!</p>
<p>But why am I still here? I cant be lazy!     610</p>
<p>I have to use this opportunity!</p>
<p>So many ways are opening for me!</p>
<p>He ran from where he was and reached a gate.</p>
<p>They might wake up. I hope its not too late!</p>
<p>The camp was still in silence. On he went.</p>
<p>The captain must be in the biggest tent!</p>
<p>He moved his steps to reach the biggest one</p>
<p>which stood alone; with wood and skins twas done.</p>
<p>His nerves were breaking for that intense tension.</p>
<p>He moved towards the tent of great dimension.    620</p>
<p>Im here. The time has come. I must get in.</p>
<p>Be God with me. Well, this is not a sin.</p>
<p>A sleeping poison offers Victory:</p>
<p>it is a perfect key to History.</p>
<p>I cannot fail. I wont. He moved inside</p>
<p>the tent, his potion hanging by his side.</p>
<p>He sleeps. But now, how can I make him drink?</p>
<p>His fear showed him an abyss: on the brink</p>
<p>he was, and falling; flames were all around.</p>
<p>He frightened when he heard of chains a sound.    630</p>
<p>He heard a voice: The Bard! He has been taken!</p>
<p>If I leave him, my name will be forsaken!</p>
<p>He found new strength. He poured his poison deep</p>
<p>into the throat of his foe, who did sleep.</p>
<p>Ive made it! Now I have to find the mage,</p>
<p>who killed my men. Im blindenèd by rage!</p>
<p>I want revenge! I have to clear my thought,</p>
<p>or like my friend to chains I will be brought.</p>
<p>I must be quiet. Noises would awake</p>
<p>the mage, who bites and kills as does a snake.    640</p>
<p>He left the tent. The problem is: in which</p>
<p>of all the tents is he? As dark as pitch</p>
<p>was night; a star, alone but bright, did shine.</p>
<p>It showed a symbol on a tent. Hes mine!</p>
<p>He must be there! I recognise that flag!</p>
<p>Its kept not well, it seems a humble rag,</p>
<p>but its the sign of killing wizards! Ive</p>
<p>seen it before! Thats where I have to dive!</p>
<p>He went into the tent and poured his drink</p>
<p>into his open mouth. In chains youll sink!    650</p>
<p>And now I have to find my friend. He must</p>
<p>be kept in chains and falling into dust.</p>
<p>I have to find him, then we will escape.</p>
<p>He left the gloomy tent. I see a shape&hellip;</p>
<p>A soldier! Quick, somewhere I have to hide!</p>
<p>Outside remaining is a suicide!</p>
<p>He visited the mage again, but&hellip; No!</p>
<p>The soldiers coming here! How could I know?</p>
<p>Where can I hide? Perhaps behind this chest&hellip;</p>
<p>The soldier came. O wizard, stop your rest!    660</p>
<p>We have a prisoner who does not speak!</p>
<p>The mage awoke. Uh&hellip; Soldier, I feel weak&hellip;</p>
<p>He tried to move, but could not find his strength.</p>
<p>I need more sleep. He lied in all his length.</p>
<p>My sire, we cant wait. So call your king!</p>
<p>I feel so tired! Songs of sleep I sing.</p>
<p>Well, then, goodbye. See you tomorrow. Bye.</p>
<p>The wizard slept. Im still alive! The sky</p>
<p>has sent an angel just for me! &hellip; But still</p>
<p>the Bard is kept as prisoner. My will     670</p>
<p>is just to set him free and go back home.</p>
<p>He left the tent ant through the tents did roam.</p>
<p>Eventually, he heard the Bards strong voice.</p>
<p>But you can talk or die. You have the choice.</p>
<p>Your torture does not frighten me at all.</p>
<p>Your courages great, my friend. You dont appal.</p>
<p>Im not a friend of yours, you ugly beast!</p>
<p>What sense of humour! Ill prepare a feast!</p>
<p>Thats him! My greatest friend! I feel so proud!</p>
<p>But then he heard his voice that shouted loud.    680</p>
<p>You suffer! This is giving me much pleasure!</p>
<p>The Knight blew up: his rage had passed the measure.</p>
<p>He ran in, saw the guard and knocked him down.</p>
<p>The Knight! My friend, its me! Why do you frown?</p>
<p>You risked too much! I cannot leave a friend</p>
<p>inside the foemens clawèd killing hand!</p>
<p>Youre much too kind to me! You have to tell</p>
<p>my story to the world! I hear a bell!</p>
<p>They must have found their captain and their mage!</p>
<p>Lets run back home! Good choice! You are a sage!   690</p>
<p>Your sense of humour is not lost! Good sign!</p>
<p>We cannot wait! Youre right, dear friend of mine!</p>
<p>Escaping is the end of my great plan!</p>
<p>The Bard was injurèd, but quickly ran.</p>
<p>Youre tough! The cause of all this strength is fear!</p>
<p>Lets keep on running, enemies are near!</p>
<p>Some guards pursued them: none did ride a horse.</p>
<p>The hunted felt in them a higher force</p>
<p>that made them run so fast to safer places.</p>
<p>They were two men that Gods good arm embraces.    700</p>
<p>They rushed. The Sun was rising from afar.</p>
<p>The Sun! Our Fathers showing us his star!</p>
<p>That star was rising on the men who won:</p>
<p>the Knight, the Poet, brothers of the Sun.</p>
<p>They found their captains anxious. Bard! Youre here!</p>
<p>I am a Poet, and I need a beer!</p>
<p>Im hurt, I need the taste of strongest ale.</p>
<p>It cannot heal your wounds! You are too pale!</p>
<p>You need a doctor! Why? Im here at home!</p>
<p>I feel Im safe! A doctor with a tome     710</p>
<p>can help, but home is what doth really heal!</p>
<p>So make me feel at home! It cant be real!</p>
<p>Your bodys very strong, as is your mind!</p>
<p>Im proud of my best friend, he is not blind!</p>
<p>He sees beyond the common things; a lot</p>
<p>of men cant do the same. Hes got&hellip;</p>
<p>Dont praise me, Knight. Youre generous too much.</p>
<p>Youre real a Knight, you must be known as such.</p>
<p>You saved my life by risking yours. I owe</p>
<p>my life to you.  This is a fact to know!     720</p>
<p>Lets stop: I hear a noise of weapons, close.</p>
<p>A gang of foes approaches! Dont oppose!</p>
<p>The enemies were few, and no one had</p>
<p>a mace or sword. We come in peace! They read:</p>
<p>As King, I ask for mercy. One</p>
<p>of you has poisoned me.</p>
<p>I cannot move. I say youve won.</p>
<p>I hope your name to see</p>
<p>upon this treaty, which is calling</p>
<p>for Peace. I say Ive lost.       730</p>
<p>And yesterday our men were falling:</p>
<p>a life is high a cost.</p>
<p>I understand that killing men</p>
<p>is wrong. I want to live.</p>
<p>I hope, dear King, well meet again</p>
<p>as friends, one day. Forgive</p>
<p>my will for war: I was insane.</p>
<p>I knew your Queen was dead:</p>
<p>your kingdom seemed a land to gain</p>
<p>with little blood to shed.       740</p>
<p>I ask for mercy. Lets be friends,</p>
<p>as neighbours all should be.</p>
<p>I want a peace that never ends.</p>
<p>Please, write your name for me.</p>
<p>The Knight was shocked. He seems sincere. All right,</p>
<p>Ill sign. He wrote these words: The King Last Knight.</p>
<p>That was his name. This war is over. Yes!</p>
<p>We must be some of those that God did bless.</p>
<p>A feast I want to celebrate this day!</p>
<p>The castle waits for us: lets go away!     750</p>
<p>The captains and the soldiers happy were</p>
<p>to see their families again. Yes, sir!</p>
<p>This order is the best to get; Im glad</p>
<p>to go back home and sleep in my own bed.</p>
<p>They put away the objects of destruction</p>
<p>to take again the tools of food production.</p>
<p>The normal situation had returned,</p>
<p>although the wounds of war still deeply burned.</p>
<p>The dead were honourèd by all the others.</p>
<p>Goodbye forever. God, accept these brothers.    760</p>
<p>These soldiers died for You and for their nation.</p>
<p>Please keep their souls, until the Reincarnation.</p>
<h1 id="part-iii--the-kingdom">Part III  The Kingdom</h1>
<p>A lot of all the soldiers lived in farms.</p>
<p>The nobles put away, like them, the arms.</p>
<p>Who were the noblemen, who helped the King?</p>
<p>The six Ive told about. I want to bring</p>
<p>these characters to you, to make them live</p>
<p>beyond their life. This hope you can forgive.</p>
<p>Their lives beyond the gates of Time can spread.</p>
<p>The noblemen were six, as I have said.     770</p>
<p>The Bard was one: hes known. To write he chose</p>
<p>and had the laws respected all. The nose</p>
<p>another noble had was source of smiles.</p>
<p>His skin, his hair, his eyes were dark as piles</p>
<p>of coal. Another one sometimes was vicious:</p>
<p>he loved his smoke and drinks and foods delicious;</p>
<p>but, after all, his heart was good. His eyes</p>
<p>showed this: they were as blue as highest skies.</p>
<p>He also loved to play his instrument:</p>
<p>guitar, of which he was a monument.      780</p>
<p>And one was small and witty: dark his hair,</p>
<p>and so his eyes. A smile was always there</p>
<p>upon his face. Another one was tall,</p>
<p>green-eyed and brown-long-haired; he heard the call</p>
<p>of Music as the Bard heard that of writing.</p>
<p>The last good man refused the most exciting</p>
<p>events of Life. He had a strange behaviour.</p>
<p>Some people thought he talked with God the Saviour.</p>
<p>His eyes were shining bright and showed his pride.</p>
<p>His hair was brown. Few times he did decide.    790</p>
<p>Their names were: Mecker, Haden, Thross, Egunt</p>
<p>and Köx. Their minds, which ruled, were never blunt.</p>
<p>The women, twelve they were, before I wrote.</p>
<p>They all were women good, on whom to dote.</p>
<p>Reyenn had copper hair; she was green-eyed</p>
<p>and fatty, but sincere: shed never lied.</p>
<p>Beriane was tall; black hair her head did cover;</p>
<p>blue-eyed, of sweets and pets she was a lover.</p>
<p>Briky was black in hair and eyes and nice;</p>
<p>her body was of Beauty a device.      800</p>
<p>The blonde Shekenn was not so bright, but she</p>
<p>was sensitive; her dark eyes, vast as sea.</p>
<p>Like her was Chie, whose eyes instead were bright:</p>
<p>so was her joyful heart; her world was right.</p>
<p>Then there was Baecie, whose brown hair was long</p>
<p>and curled; her eyes were splendid, good, not strong.</p>
<p>Lyrinn had golden hair; her eyes were dark;</p>
<p>she left in those who saw her face a mark.</p>
<p>Tallyé, like her, had eyes of black; her hair</p>
<p>was like dark gold; her heart was sweet and fair.   810</p>
<p>Sophenn was prosperous, with eyes of green</p>
<p>and brown-red hair, and clever as the Queen.</p>
<p>Prigue was small, with short fair hair, and thin;</p>
<p>her shining eyes showed all her thoughts within.</p>
<p>Theilenn had dark long hair and eyes; with Nature</p>
<p>she loved to stay, which made her thoughts be mature.</p>
<p>Radyell had shorter hair, but it was brown</p>
<p>like hers; her emrald eyes did never frown.</p>
<p>Some verses to each one I dedicate;</p>
<p>I was inspired by my life, I state.      820</p>
<p>They may be not the Truth, but Poesy,</p>
<p>completely, cant reflect Reality.</p>
<p>What happens now? You want some more events.</p>
<p>Ill try to write about new incidents.</p>
<p>The noblemen were coming back from war.</p>
<p>You saved us, Knight: we live just for your core.</p>
<p>Ive made my duty. Nothing else. I need</p>
<p>some peace and rest, and something good to read.</p>
<p>Ill try to write a song, like writers old,</p>
<p>about this kingdom, happy, never cold,     830</p>
<p>so full of life, with angry people scarce.</p>
<p>I wish you wrote a comedy, a farce.</p>
<p>I see, my Knight. You want to laugh a lot!</p>
<p>Well then. Ill try to write a happy plot.</p>
<p>But not today. I need events of joy,</p>
<p>such as a girl who tries to find a boy</p>
<p>to live with, or the opposite. Such plays</p>
<p>are great as masterpieces, people says.</p>
<p>But this is not the time to write. Not yet.</p>
<p>Ill wait for you to write your play. I bet    840</p>
<p>it will be great. This story cannot keep</p>
<p>a plot inside; but, if we see more deep,</p>
<p>we find this story is a tragedy.</p>
<p>I want to put somewhere a comedy.</p>
<p>The tone is still so bitter, some have died;</p>
<p>I need some happiness. Some man a bride</p>
<p>must find. But this is not the truth. I said</p>
<p>I based myself on my own life: its sad,</p>
<p>but Im alone. I cant give happiness,</p>
<p>not yet. But I must do someday, I guess.     850</p>
<p>Some character will find the satisfaction</p>
<p>of Love, the strangest chemical reaction.</p>
<p>I still dont know what does the future hide,</p>
<p>just little I am able to decide.</p>
<p>The present brought just hopes that fell in vain.</p>
<p>This story is a written form of pain.</p>
<p>This story, thus, will never make you laugh.</p>
<p>About the plans I have Ive said enough.</p>
<p>I see the Bard has promised you a song.</p>
<p>This ones like Dantes ones, if Im not wrong&hellip;   860</p>
<p>Through all the parts, the rhyme scheme is a link.</p>
<p>Youre going to hear a rhythm new, I think.</p>
<p>Happy this kingdom, where lives the Last Knight!</p>
<p>He is the King, and he rules with no fear.</p>
<p>Blue are the sky and the ocean that here</p>
<p>fill the horizon and please every eye.</p>
<p>Sweet is the wind in the darkness of night;</p>
<p>white is the light that the sky lets, so clear,</p>
<p>come from the lady, the Moon, so sincere.</p>
<p>Nothing is gloomy: you know I dont lie.     870</p>
<p>Flowers are growing and never will die</p>
<p>under the sunshine that covers this land;</p>
<p>trees through the ages victorious will stand.</p>
<p>Nothing is evil beneath such a sky:</p>
<p>everythings perfect. Im telling, I swear,</p>
<p>true words of praise, as my joy I cant bear.</p>
<p>The King, the Last Knight, is ruling alone:</p>
<p>the Queen, who had died, assigned him the crown;</p>
<p>he legally got the power. We drown</p>
<p>in tears as we think the Queen is now dead.    880</p>
<p>A dragon had widowed her: on the throne</p>
<p>she sat with no one; her hopes fell all down.</p>
<p>The Knight won the beast; by God he was shown</p>
<p>the way to defeat the Dragon big, red.</p>
<p>He tamed with the help of God, as I said,</p>
<p>the Dragon, whose skin form red turned to gold:</p>
<p>a miracle was this fact  just been told.</p>
<p>They flied to the castle, happy and glad;</p>
<p>the Queen, she was dying: a withering flower.</p>
<p>She gave to the Knight the crown and the power.    890</p>
<p>The greatest mourning has given this land</p>
<p>as King the Last of the Knights. We can see</p>
<p>the sky, the sun, all the stars and the sea</p>
<p>because he saved all this land from damnation.</p>
<p>The seven nobles, together they stand</p>
<p>with twelve the ladies; and joined they will be</p>
<p>forever, always: from guilt they are free.</p>
<p>They fill with joy all the hearts in the nation.</p>
<p>Afraid was people of plague and starvation</p>
<p>when she, the Queen, died: all hopes seemed to fall.   900</p>
<p>The Last of Knights heard from Heaven a call.</p>
<p>He had the power to take to salvation</p>
<p>all men. He also is known as a hero</p>
<p>because he fights with a fear numberd zero.</p>
<p>How happy this kingdom where lives the Last</p>
<p>of Knights! Hes the King, and you know him well.</p>
<p>You ought to come here: if you cast a spell</p>
<p>perhaps you might find what is happiness.</p>
<p>The door is not closed to come here: just cast</p>
<p>a spell in your dreams and youll break the shell   910</p>
<p>of Real. I have followed this way I tell</p>
<p>to come to this world, where the fears are less.</p>
<p>The Kings lead their pawns, like a game of chess:</p>
<p>this world is a tale, but, like chess, they fight:</p>
<p>the Foe is the Evil, the Kings the Knight.</p>
<p>The faces of people, big smiles do dress,</p>
<p>because they can work and theyre free to live:</p>
<p>by doing what they feel, they make joy arrive.</p>
<p>Song, please go and steal the hearts of all men:</p>
<p>make them dream and feel some joy and relief    920</p>
<p>from the daily sufferings: be a thief,</p>
<p>gentle, noble, clever, cunning and good.</p>
<p>Song, please bring Imagination again</p>
<p>to the minds of men who say days are brief</p>
<p>when they work as slaves, or maybe as chiefs:</p>
<p>they must rest and dream or bad is their mood.</p>
<p>Song, please go to those who have understood</p>
<p>why the King Last Knight is fighting: they need</p>
<p>his example as of Courage a seed.</p>
<p>Song, find those who think this story is good:    930</p>
<p>youre for them. I hope they like you, your law</p>
<p>made of rhythm and of rhymes I did draw.</p>
<p>Its over. Well, what do you think? I hope</p>
<p>Ive written well: with verses I did cope.</p>
<p>Its over now; lets try to find events.</p>
<p>The Knight&hellip; he was back home, with compliments.</p>
<p>His people all was proud of him; his name</p>
<p>was called around, and brought to him great fame.</p>
<p>His strength and wisdom could deserve belief;</p>
<p>the reign was prospering, with such a chief.    940</p>
<p>One day, a fact occurred. The Knight awoke</p>
<p>and found his room was hidden all by smoke.</p>
<p>His eyes were burning; he could hardly find</p>
<p>some air to breathe; he thought he would get blind.</p>
<p>He found the window, opened it and air</p>
<p>blew in. The wind was like a woman fair,</p>
<p>who kissed his face with fresh and soft a kiss</p>
<p>and brought him life. I was about to miss</p>
<p>my life! What made this smoke? I was so close</p>
<p>to Death! What flame or blaze this all did cause?   950</p>
<p>His servants came, the flames were washed away.</p>
<p>This seems to be the dawn of one bad day!</p>
<p>The Knight was shocked. They took him to the throne;</p>
<p>still frightenèd, the Knight began to moan.</p>
<p>If I had died!&hellip; But youre alive, my sire!</p>
<p>You know I might have died in such a fire!</p>
<p>Somebody would have taken on the reign.</p>
<p>My friend, comforting word you need not feign!</p>
<p>Im much too young to die! Who would forsake</p>
<p>my name? Nobodys tears my death would take!    960</p>
<p>I want to leave a sign of me through time,</p>
<p>that men will know forever, like a rhyme;</p>
<p>I need a lady by my side, a Queen</p>
<p>to tame my heart; you know what I can mean.
Part IV  Insanity and Redemption</p>
<p>From now another story I must start,</p>
<p>about the Last Knights love. I hope that Art</p>
<p>will lead me on this path, so steep, so long.</p>
<p>To tell about this passion, heres a song.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What feeling great is Love!</li>
</ul>
<p>It holds all human hearts from high above! -    970</p>
<p>A part of Love is red:</p>
<p>this force that fights, like eagles, peace of mind</p>
<p>is Passion, driving mad;</p>
<p>it takes control an makes our reason blind.</p>
<p>Its nails our torments spread,</p>
<p>it prowls us till some one to love we find.</p>
<p>It brings the greatest joys and pains assigned</p>
<p>to human life and forces us to move.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What feeling great is Love!</li>
</ul>
<p>It holds all human hearts from high above! -    980</p>
<p>A part of Love is white</p>
<p>and comes from mind, which seeks for satisfaction.</p>
<p>Of sentiment in spite,</p>
<p>we cannot live with one whos not reflection</p>
<p>of us: a pain would bite,</p>
<p>tormenting psyche, leaving out perfectioin.</p>
<p>Aesthetic choices ought to rule attraction;</p>
<p>the eagle must be beaten by the dove.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What feeling great is Love!</li>
</ul>
<p>It holds all human hearts from high above! -    990</p>
<p>A part of Love, its clear,</p>
<p>is bodily: its physical desire.</p>
<p>Not only lust is here,</p>
<p>there are aspect and gestures kind. The fire</p>
<p>of Passion, Im sincere,</p>
<p>is lit by Beauty, which can never tire.</p>
<p>The right aspect frees mind from pain and ire;</p>
<p>caresses, kisses, hugs affection prove.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What feeling great is Love!</li>
</ul>
<p>It holds all human hearts from high above! -    1000</p>
<p>This ballad, short, was made by me to keep</p>
<p>for you my thoughts, which time perhaps wont sweep.</p>
<p>The Knight looked for a woman, who could soothe</p>
<p>his killing need of Love, with hands silk-smooth</p>
<p>to touch, with eyes to gaze, with thoughts to share</p>
<p>and with a lovely sentiment to care.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, his passion made him think</p>
<p>of all nice girls: his eyes in them did sink.</p>
<p>He could not choose but listen to their voices</p>
<p>so full of charm for him: he had no choices.    1010</p>
<p>The servants saw the Knights behaviour change.</p>
<p>I wonder why the King is now so strange.</p>
<p>I know th reason why the king seems stupid!</p>
<p>A dart was thrown; an angel threw it: Cupid!</p>
<p>All womens eyes do launch to him this arrow,</p>
<p>which, as you know, a human heart can harrow.</p>
<p>He must get mad, unless he comes to choose</p>
<p>the woman best to turn his senses loose.</p>
<p>You can explore his soul as deep as mine!</p>
<p>Theres nothing wrong: hes just a friend of mine.   1020</p>
<p>This servant, tall and strong, with eyes of dark,</p>
<p>could see in him of Love the clearest mark.</p>
<p>The Knight could hardly eat or drink or sleep:</p>
<p>the scars that Love had spread were much too deep.</p>
<p>It took him lots of days to choose a girl.</p>
<p>Radyell: on her his choices stopped to twirl.</p>
<p>She was no more transcending, like a vision,</p>
<p>but down on Earth, when he took his decision.</p>
<p>That day he found Radyell alone. He moved</p>
<p>to her and said: Radyell, youre my beloved.    1030</p>
<p>His heart was like a&hellip; nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>I dont pretend or lie, Im not an actor!</p>
<p>She gazed at him with great astonishment.</p>
<p>He spoke these words with all his sentiment.</p>
<p>No love was ever strong as mine for you;</p>
<p>you are the one who makes my soul complete;</p>
<p>an angel, come from Heaven, made us meet;</p>
<p>to Natures skills of art your charm is due.</p>
<p>You come to Earth as light as morning dew;</p>
<p>you breathe a healing breeze, so warm and sweet;   1040</p>
<p>your heart and mine in synchrony do beat;</p>
<p>perfection as in thee I never knew.</p>
<p>With you, my love and life would last forever;</p>
<p>you stole my mind, I cannot think nor act;</p>
<p>you hold my heart, in your good hands it lies.</p>
<p>Just yield and let my mind again be clever!</p>
<p>Your love would be for me a sacred pact!</p>
<p>Grant thou and we shall pass the seven skies!</p>
<p>Radyell, a bit surprised, began to muse</p>
<p>then said: Im sorry, Knight, but I refuse.    1050</p>
<p>Youre not the kind of man with whom Id live.</p>
<p>Whats wrong in me? What sin you cant forgive?</p>
<p>I fear the passion eating through your brain;</p>
<p>irrationaltiy I really fear;</p>
<p>beside your burning flame, my roots would sear;</p>
<p>a blaze like this can not be stopped by rain.</p>
<p>Your passion is a great, tormenting strain:</p>
<p>let Mind be strong as Heart or you will tear;</p>
<p>I know your heart is good and pure and dear,</p>
<p>but its too loose: your reason it can drain.    1060</p>
<p>I dont need love as you: I want to wait</p>
<p>and choose with calm the one wholl live with me.</p>
<p>Id rather live alone than with the wrong one.</p>
<p>We can be simply friends, but even great.</p>
<p>Your heart shall open with another key.</p>
<p>By someone else will be your heart, so strong, won.</p>
<p>The Knight could hardly bear this heavy shock.</p>
<p>Your sober heart is rough as rigid rock!</p>
<p>He growled these angry words. He drew his blade</p>
<p>and said: I want my soul away to fade!     1070</p>
<p>Dont kill yourself or youll be damned! Do stop!</p>
<p>You still dare talk? My sword I shall not drop!</p>
<p>But think of all the things that you would leave!</p>
<p>You have no voice for me! Why should I live?</p>
<p>You are beside yourself! Relax and think!</p>
<p>This sword is now a pen, my blood is ink.</p>
<p>He hit his leg. She launched herself on him.</p>
<p>Inside a pool of blood I want to swim!</p>
<p>Remember: youre a King! You rule a land!</p>
<p>I do not care! But&hellip; dont you understand?    1080</p>
<p>No man can live with Death inside his heart!</p>
<p>Youve just killed me! A murderess thou art!</p>
<p>His eyes were flashing. Knight, youre crazy! Why</p>
<p>you want to die? You simply have to try</p>
<p>again with someone else. There is a star</p>
<p>somewhere for you, and maybe not too far.</p>
<p>Dont try to hold me or Ill kill you too!</p>
<p>The Knight escaped from her. Youre full of rue.</p>
<p>Your eyes are red of blood because your pride</p>
<p>turned Passion into Will of Suicide.     1090</p>
<p>You dont need anger, but another chance.</p>
<p>Let your good sense again be your defence.</p>
<p>If Loves a game, just roll again the dice!</p>
<p>You would not understand my sacrifice.</p>
<p>He dropped his sword. I cannot choose but thee;</p>
<p>but you dont see, and thus I have to flee.</p>
<p>The Knight began to run. He was insane.</p>
<p>He left his castle and his good twelve friends.</p>
<p>They tried to stop him, but it wais in vain.</p>
<p>This is the moment when my story ends.     1100</p>
<p>The Devils haunting me, I am in Hell!</p>
<p>I leave, my brothers! Dont you wave your hands!</p>
<p>Since I must die, what else is there to tell?</p>
<p>The one who waits for me is now my grave.</p>
<p>I want to go where other people fell.</p>
<p>He reached a battlefield, where soldiers brave</p>
<p>had died: their corpses lay still there, all dead.</p>
<p>Of Love, the heart-destroyer, Im a slave.</p>
<p>The Knight then felt a pressure in his head.</p>
<p>He rushed to all directions, here and there:    1110</p>
<p>by his insanity the Knight was led.</p>
<p>He spoke some nonsense words; he drew a square</p>
<p>and said Thats her! and then he did blaspheme;</p>
<p>he tried to beat down trees just like a bear.</p>
<p>(Im sorry but my words are like a stream:</p>
<p>they cant be stopped. They form the wrong rhyme scheme:</p>
<p>to ask for your excuses I must dare.)</p>
<p>Where is my sword? It certainly was lost.</p>
<p>These wooden beasts are hard, with my hands bare,</p>
<p>to fight: but luckily theyre stopped by frost.   1120</p>
<p>He ran around and, in this sort of flight,</p>
<p>he crossed his kingdom. What he fearèd most</p>
<p>were those he met and greeted him as Knight.</p>
<p>What is a Knight? I never have seen one!</p>
<p>But youre a Knight and King, a guiding light!</p>
<p>You joke! Im not such thing! Your mind is gone!</p>
<p>and then he fled again; in him, just grief.</p>
<p>He could not find a rest: he had to run,</p>
<p>as sharks must swim. His heart had no relief.</p>
<p>Some voices grew on him: The Knight is crazy!    1130</p>
<p>The people had no more a guide, a chief.</p>
<p>The workers stopped to work or went on lazy.</p>
<p>We need to see our leader: where is he?</p>
<p>The Knight was erring still, by rivers mazy</p>
<p>that from the springs went flowing to the sea.</p>
<p>He saw the sea. Some rain began to drop.</p>
<p>He dived and felt the water all around.</p>
<p>Outside, the fall of water did not stop.</p>
<p>A thunder then, with its exploding sound,</p>
<p>did crack the sky. A bell in me now chimes!    1140</p>
<p>It was his Reason which no more was bound.</p>
<p>(Im writing now again the correct rhymes.</p>
<p>I hate to make this kind of big mistake:</p>
<p>it even migth be put among the crimes.)</p>
<p>The Knight, who saw again, his breath did take</p>
<p>and sat upon the sand; his eyes were dim:</p>
<p>he closed his eyes and slept for sleepings sake.</p>
<p>When he woke up, the sun was high on him:</p>
<p>he realised that he had slept one day;</p>
<p>then in his conscience he began to swim.     1150</p>
<p>O God, what have I done? What can I say?</p>
<p>My mind had gone because of Passions claw,</p>
<p>to Reason I no longer could obey.</p>
<p>I acted free from any mortal law,</p>
<p>morality was not my guide at all</p>
<p>because Radyells enchanting eyes I saw.</p>
<p>It turnd me loose from Common Senses call.</p>
<p>Her beauty took my senses and my heart,</p>
<p>but in my arms she did refuse to fall.</p>
<p>That pain tore all my self from part to part    1160</p>
<p>and drove me crazy: Love was then my master,</p>
<p>controlling all my mind, which was so smart.</p>
<p>And then the thunder came to save me, faster</p>
<p>than light: it was the holy light of Reason</p>
<p>that God has sent to save me from disaster.</p>
<p>It was my passion that brought mind to treason;</p>
<p>my love was strong much more than I could drink:</p>
<p>it sotted me, and lasted for a season.</p>
<p>The thunders sound was briefer that a wink;</p>
<p>it cracked the sky and then, I wonder why,    1170</p>
<p>my thoughts came back, as fallen from a brink.</p>
<p>I see again the sun that shines up high;</p>
<p>it shows the path that leads me back to home</p>
<p>but I wont follow it: Id rather die!</p>
<p>I think, instead, that I shall mix with foam</p>
<p>and, free from her, Ill play with waves a game,</p>
<p>or I shall work a plain of fruitful loam.</p>
<p>If I came back, Id coverd be with shame:</p>
<p>nobody wants a King with flames inside;</p>
<p>no King or Knight I am: I change my name.     1180</p>
<p>Ill live alone. The Moon will be my bride:</p>
<p>Ill sing for her and she will answer not,</p>
<p>yet shell shine more than her for whom I died.</p>
<p>My home will be a cavern never hot;</p>
<p>Ill live respecting Nature, Gods creation,</p>
<p>the living and unliving things, their plot.</p>
<p>I must forget that once I led a nation:</p>
<p>that life is gone and never shall be back;</p>
<p>theyll find, for my behaviour, explanation.</p>
<p>The colour of my heart is gloomy black;     1190</p>
<p>Ill find my peace in God, who loves all men</p>
<p>who trust in Him: and thus my soul wont crack.</p>
<p>A hermit I will be, inside my den,</p>
<p>a hole cut deep in rock: a house of stone,</p>
<p>abandoned by some beast, will mine be when</p>
<p>I find it: and Ill live in peace, alone,</p>
<p>divided from mankind, which hurt me so,</p>
<p>and I will feed on whats by Nature done.</p>
<p>When I meet Death, Ill coverd be by snow:</p>
<p>it gently shall descend on me; no urn     1200</p>
<p>will keep my ashes, but no one will know.</p>
<p>As I decided that I wont return,</p>
<p>the memory of me will slowly fade</p>
<p>like fallen yellow leaves in flames theyll burn.</p>
<p>Ill turn to dust, because of dust were made:</p>
<p>the wind will blow my body to the wild</p>
<p>where I was born. Ill rest behind the shade</p>
<p>of the familiar tree that, as a child,</p>
<p>I used to climb: Ill see its leafy face,</p>
<p>and birds will sing for me their songs so mild.    1210</p>
<p>Its Death the destiny of human race:</p>
<p>we have to face it with a mind still clear,</p>
<p>we cant forget a graves the final place.</p>
<p>Alone with my religion, I wont fear</p>
<p>the storms of life that tempt my soul to sin;</p>
<p>Ill live in sanctity. God might appear!</p>
<p>I realise that chills now bite my skin;</p>
<p>I need to hie to find for me a house,</p>
<p>or ice will break my body from within.</p>
<p>I need a hole to sleep in, like a mouse.     1220</p>
<p>He wanderd through some hills and mountains steep</p>
<p>for many weeks. His luck did not arouse.</p>
<p>Eventually, he found a cavern deep</p>
<p>enough to hide him, fresh and strangely clean,</p>
<p>where he could store the food he found and sleep.</p>
<p>He also tried to cultivate some bean:</p>
<p>it grew. Outside his cavern plants grew well;</p>
<p>he made a garden, little but not lean.</p>
<p>Nobody ever came to see his shell:</p>
<p>the place was far away from every town.     1230</p>
<p>He put his water in his private well.</p>
<p>I am in Heaven: all the seeds Ive sown</p>
<p>have fastly grown; theres water, food; I rest</p>
<p>without disturb; disasters dont fall down.</p>
<p>I never see the things I might detest:</p>
<p>a human being, a beast, a plague, a gale.</p>
<p>Im sure that this condition is the best.</p>
<p>The Moon is watching me, it is so pale</p>
<p>yet splendid, shining, sending beams and tears;</p>
<p>as long as shes with me, I cannot fail.     1240</p>
<p>Inside my cavern I will stay for years;</p>
<p>Im safe. Outside, the sun would show my scars</p>
<p>that she, Radyell, traced: here I have no fears,</p>
<p>and here Ill stay forever with those stars.</p>
<p>Those stars were watched by all his friends, eighteen,</p>
<p>in that same moment: how those stars were seen!</p>
<p>Ive found that dreams must never turn to real</p>
<p>or they would stop to have their strong appeal.</p>
<p>She was a dream that never could be true;</p>
<p>I understand my fate: the love that grew     1250</p>
<p>in me was much too strong, she could not yield</p>
<p>to me, she used morality as shield</p>
<p>to keep herself secure from my attack:</p>
<p>and this was right, but sombre, deeply black.</p>
<p>It gave my heart an ache, but now Im healed:</p>
<p>my Lord his will for me has just revealed.</p>
<p>The kind of life most suitable for me</p>
<p>is that of hermit: well, thats  what Ill be.</p>
<p>My dreams could not be true, they were utopia;</p>
<p>I can see this: Im healed from my myopia.    1260
Part V  Falling into Darkness</p>
<p>In those same moments, all the nobles were</p>
<p>deciding how to take the Knight back there.</p>
<p>He cannot stay so far away from us,</p>
<p>unless he found a fertile ground and thus</p>
<p>he can pick fruits from Nature as a child:</p>
<p>he might be anywhere among the wild.</p>
<p>I dont think so. His homesickness must sting:</p>
<p>hell come back home as birds all do in spring.</p>
<p>I wonder if his Sword can be a guide&hellip;</p>
<p>The Holy Sword! Of course! Twas by his side,    1270</p>
<p>there is a link between the two. The Sword</p>
<p>is here. Lets hope it answers to my word.</p>
<p>O Sword, please take us to the Knight! You know</p>
<p>where he did go! The Sword began to glow.</p>
<p>Its hot! The Sword was thrown down to the floor.</p>
<p>Ive never seen a scene like this before!</p>
<p>The Sword was throwing flames to one direction.</p>
<p>It flied upon them. Power of detection</p>
<p>it had: the Knight was found. The men did follow,</p>
<p>the women stayed, to keep the throne not hollow.   1280</p>
<p>The Sword is surely led by holy forces!</p>
<p>The noblemen were led to take their horses.</p>
<p>Whats happening? The Dragon, just awaken,</p>
<p>said this. Well find, unless we have mistaken</p>
<p>the sign, the Knight! Oh! Let me come with you!</p>
<p>He might be used to cross the sky of blue!</p>
<p>All right, then. Dragon, follow just the fire.</p>
<p>The path is shown! Im riding on a wire!</p>
<p>The dragon flied, the nobles cried Beware!</p>
<p>He files so fast that he can blast the air!    1290</p>
<p>Horse-riders, you are slow! Do take a ride</p>
<p>on me and stride! This cannon hurt your pride!</p>
<p>Youre right! Lets waste no time! Lets fly together!</p>
<p>They put on him their saddles made of leather.</p>
<p>Lets go! And on they went. I need not say</p>
<p>some other things: they flied, for one whole day.</p>
<p>Its true that I dont feel the need of actions,</p>
<p>I much prefer to write about reflections.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Knight was found and shocked.</p>
<p>You here?! By nothing ever you were blocked?    1300</p>
<p>The Holy Sword has shown the path to you.</p>
<p>So you are here. I cannot stand its true.</p>
<p>My friends, I pray: please, go away. My reign</p>
<p>is yours, youre kings! Your presence brings me rain.</p>
<p>Your soul is wounded deep. You need a balm.</p>
<p>My words shall be the ones that keep you calm.</p>
<p>Ill never go to what was once my house!</p>
<p>A girl there lives wholl never be my spouse!</p>
<p>O Bard, dear friend, you understand my grief.</p>
<p>Alone, my mind and heart can find relief.     1310</p>
<p>I would not bear to see again that witch,</p>
<p>who chew my love and spat it in a ditch.</p>
<p>Your words that pour despair</p>
<p>seem true, but they are false:</p>
<p>no man alone can dare</p>
<p>to live, because love calls.</p>
<p>A heart like yours is rare:</p>
<p>a great bell is, that tolls</p>
<p>in you and makes you stare</p>
<p>at women in the halls.        1320</p>
<p>As you, I like to see</p>
<p>their beauty, close to art:</p>
<p>they make our senses flee,</p>
<p>through sight they throw a dart;</p>
<p>without them, we cant be:</p>
<p>they are of us a part.</p>
<p>She simply was the right one for some other.</p>
<p>Come back with me, Ill be your younger brother.</p>
<p>I want, I need to talk to her, before</p>
<p>I come back home, where I have left my core.    1330</p>
<p>Well bring her here. You simply have to wait.</p>
<p>If you return, well have a joy so great!</p>
<p>A moment, friend. Not taken is my will.</p>
<p>I may decide to stay where am I, still.</p>
<p>I know, I know. So tense must be your nerves.</p>
<p>But youre the Knight, the man your reign deserves!</p>
<p>I might go home and then, with her, return.</p>
<p>You all must go or else, you know, Id burn.</p>
<p>All right, but be prepared for your decision.</p>
<p>I know youll come, its certain as a vision.    1340</p>
<p>Goodbye, great Knight. By holy light youre shown.</p>
<p>Before youre old, youll have your golden throne.</p>
<p>My friend, goodbye. Be quick and fly up high&hellip;</p>
<p>The bard now leaves. As fallen leaves I sigh.</p>
<p>I fear to go back where I once did rule.</p>
<p>I feel as obstinated as a mule:</p>
<p>its perfect here, I have no fear at all.</p>
<p>To stay I long, I feel no strong recall.</p>
<p>Inside my cave I feel so brave! But right</p>
<p>is that I bring to men, as King, my light.    1350</p>
<p>Its hard to make this choice. My friends will find</p>
<p>the correct answer, hidden now: Im blind.</p>
<p>The six did fly for one whole day again.</p>
<p>They could not know what lies inside my pen&hellip;</p>
<p>Their fate is sealed. Theyll soon be full of terror</p>
<p>without a sin or any kind of error&hellip;</p>
<p>I want to rise in you anxiety:</p>
<p>their guilt all lies inside society.</p>
<p>Just wait and see what I have chosen for</p>
<p>those men. Lets go again through pages door.    1360</p>
<p>The Dragon landed by the city wall.</p>
<p>The door was open, so they enterd all.</p>
<p>The city was in turmoil: shrieking boys,</p>
<p>the clash of weapons&hellip; any kind of noise;</p>
<p>all people ran as waves, their sea did roar.</p>
<p>But what&hellip; The city seems in state of war!</p>
<p>A voice rose up amongst this great confusion:</p>
<p>Are those the men or its a mere illusion?</p>
<p>Its them! Call here the guards! Theyll take them to</p>
<p>the King Hafald, wholl choose what we must do!   1370</p>
<p>What name you say? Hafald? It sound unknown!</p>
<p>Well, hes the King, hes taken your old throne!</p>
<p>The only King, who rules by choice divine,</p>
<p>is the Last Knight! Your man is just a swine!</p>
<p>Blasphemous man! Youll taste his vengeance sour!</p>
<p>Arrest them, guards! Like poison words they pour!</p>
<p>The men were tied and beaten worse than porks.</p>
<p>Their peoples laughter was their Caudine Forks.</p>
<p>The horror of those faces in the crowd:</p>
<p>a demons mow, an ocean roaring loud.     1380</p>
<p>Those minutes lasted hours in their minds.</p>
<p>That inner time can change, is known by hinds.</p>
<p>The flag was not wind-beaten any more.</p>
<p>They trembled as they passed the castle door.</p>
<p>The servants looked at them with angry eyes;</p>
<p>their voices were like that of one who dies.</p>
<p>The big staircase they climbed. It seemed so steep.</p>
<p>The top of it was cloaked by darkness deep.</p>
<p>Weve come! Oh, well! Now, soldiers, let em in!</p>
<p>The squeaking door did play a mournful din.    1390</p>
<p>Im glad to see you, nobles! You I hold!</p>
<p>Moustache, black eyes and hair, he seemed so bold.</p>
<p>I am the mastermind who leads the dance!</p>
<p>Your lives are in my hands, without defence!</p>
<p>As you may see, Im now on top, youre under!</p>
<p>His voice got firm and loud: he spoke like thunder.</p>
<p>Hollow and dim is the future for you!</p>
<p>Hidden in it is a sentence to Death.</p>
<p>I am the helmsman whos steering you thro</p>
<p>water and ices, but blocked is the path.     1400</p>
<p>Now, with your women, youll die in my prisons</p>
<p>slowly, with aches, because of starvation.</p>
<p>Thus you will pay for the highest of treasons!</p>
<p>Even the Saviour wont give you salvation!</p>
<p>I am the Law and the kingdom is mine.</p>
<p>With the Last Knight, whos the first of betrayers,</p>
<p>youll find my bars and my chains that entwine.</p>
<p>People is risen! All useless are prayers!</p>
<p>You say you come from people: how can they</p>
<p>have chosen you? Not long they will obey.     1410</p>
<p>With your ideals, you wish to seem «romantic»,</p>
<p>but you are just insane, unlawful, frantic.</p>
<p>Thats what you say, with your wisdom and culture!</p>
<p>False are your words and morality now!</p>
<p>I am the hunter that slays the old vulture.</p>
<p>Power to people, you nobles must bow!</p>
<p>Kneel or yor head will be cut by my blade!</p>
<p>Justice, respect for each persons opinion:</p>
<p>this is Republic, that soon will be made!</p>
<p>Dead is your ancient, illegal dominion!     1420</p>
<p>But dont you realise weve always given</p>
<p>an answer? By all subjects we were driven!</p>
<p>You know that here a King must choose the next,</p>
<p>his follower: its written in the Text,</p>
<p>the Constitution; thus, each King is wise.</p>
<p>The Last Knight was the best, so he did rise.</p>
<p>The choice is always hard, but also good:</p>
<p>no King has ever had an evil mood.</p>
<p>Yes, but the last one has fled: he was wrong.</p>
<p>Now, Ive been chosen by women and men,     1430</p>
<p>not by one person: my power is strong.</p>
<p>Take them to prison! Im winning again!</p>
<p>The guards were rough. They brought them underground,</p>
<p>where water dripped from ceilings with a sound</p>
<p>that never stopped and could drive men insane:</p>
<p>to someones mind, it was like acid rain.</p>
<p>Well here we are. Get in and meet your women.</p>
<p>For you there are no signals of good omen.</p>
<p>This prison in the castle is the price</p>
<p>you have to pay for centuries of vice,     1440</p>
<p>of exploitation of the working classes.</p>
<p>Hafald, the leader chosen by the masses,</p>
<p>has set us free: hell find the Knight, once king,</p>
<p>and we will bring his corpse to you. I sing:</p>
<p>We have conquered freedom,</p>
<p>the sun is shining high;</p>
<p>long will live this nation,</p>
<p>no more we have to sigh.</p>
<p>Peace will last forever,</p>
<p>the battle was so hard;        1450</p>
<p>we dont need religion,</p>
<p>a man is now the guard.</p>
<p>Questions find their answers,</p>
<p>the rebels have the knife;</p>
<p>nothing more is certain</p>
<p>and so we relish Life.</p>
<p>All we need is pleasure</p>
<p>and now that we are free</p>
<p>we are led by Justice</p>
<p>to find whats good to see.       1460</p>
<p>Nothing is immoral,</p>
<p>but just against the Law;</p>
<p>days are full of beauty.</p>
<p>No thing beyond we know,</p>
<p>Man needs no transcendence,</p>
<p>the weight of daily toil</p>
<p>lighter seems, and money</p>
<p>we make from fruits of soil.</p>
<p>Its terrible! Beyond the utmost bound</p>
<p>of human thought, you heard the gloomy sound    1470</p>
<p>of Nothingness, and now you need just pleasure.</p>
<p>But dont you think that Nature gives some measure?</p>
<p>Shut up! How dare you speak? Youll feel my Hell!</p>
<p>No saving spell will open you this cell!</p>
<p>Farewell, you «nobles»! Worse you are than mice!</p>
<p>And know that Death has won you all at dice!</p>
<p>The door was shut in front of them and locked.</p>
<p>Until you die by me you will be mocked!</p>
<p>I have some torture new for you to know&hellip;</p>
<p>Youll learn to sing the sombre notes of woe!    1480</p>
<p>They laughed and went away. A woman spoke:</p>
<p>Theyve tried already to choke us with smoke.</p>
<p>A beam of light came down to show Radyell.</p>
<p>Then you are here! We have some things to tell.</p>
<p>The wet an darkened room did sound with cheers;</p>
<p>a sudden joy had swept away all fears.</p>
<p>At least were not alone! But still inside</p>
<p>these viscid walls! The sky and sun they hide!</p>
<p>It would be good to punish sin or crime,</p>
<p>but were not guilty! Why are we in slime?    1490</p>
<p>Because a madman stole the throne. He used</p>
<p>the day when you had left; we were accused</p>
<p>of treason, high, against, they said, the state.</p>
<p>And now were here and death will be our fate!</p>
<p>They give no food, just water: hunger bites.</p>
<p>Well never see again our happy sites!</p>
<p>Dont be so negative! Well find a way</p>
<p>to flee, one day! In prison we cant stay!</p>
<p>I fear your hopeful words are bound to fail.</p>
<p>Nobody ever left this hidden jail!      1500</p>
<p>And then well be the first! I wish to think</p>
<p>the same, but every minute hope does shrink!</p>
<p>But thirst of freedom wont be stopped until</p>
<p>we leave this place! And firm must be our will!</p>
<p>We know that freedom is a need</p>
<p>that lies inside each human soul.</p>
<p>Its like a tree: we have the seed</p>
<p>and it can grow with our control.</p>
<p>By laws of Nature it is led.</p>
<p>We eat its fruit when we break chains     1510</p>
<p>that tie without a reason; fed</p>
<p>we are, the feeling then remains.</p>
<p>The stronger are the chains that tie,</p>
<p>the more we like when were set free;</p>
<p>we have to suffer and to cry,</p>
<p>but we can make this destiny.</p>
<p>Good bard, your words can stop the pain, but tragic</p>
<p>the situation is: we need the help of magic.</p>
<p>You need not magic, but an alchemist!</p>
<p>I might prepare a thing no lock resists.     1520</p>
<p>But can you find the ingredients right here?</p>
<p>I dont know yet, this is my greatest fear.</p>
<p>And as we leave theyll find us very soon!</p>
<p>Well flee in darkness: clouds, no star, no moon.</p>
<p>Our future cannot be a noose of rope</p>
<p>or, worse, starvation: still we have some hope!</p>
<p>O Bard, I did not know you had some skill</p>
<p>as alchemist! With hope my heart you fill!</p>
<p>You call for hope, but free we are not yet!</p>
<p>One day not set, by us may Death be met!     1530</p>
<p>And think about the Knight, who should be here!</p>
<p>He wont appear: the end is drawing near!</p>
<p>A cloak of fear did cover them once more.</p>
<p>The hand of Fear besieged and seized each core.</p>
<p>They thought about the Knight, so far away,</p>
<p>still safe and free: and thus they spent the day.
Part VI  The Turning Point</p>
<p>Another morning came on them and him,</p>
<p>the Knight, awake when still the sky was dim.</p>
<p>Not late came dawn; the Knight did yawn and chill.</p>
<p>Be quick they must or turn to dust I will.    1540</p>
<p>He dived in rills as fresh as winds that blew</p>
<p>around his cave, and felt his strength come new.</p>
<p>Goodbye, sweet home where long I did abide!</p>
<p>My land is wide, no longer I shall hide!</p>
<p>My friends are coming: they are taking me</p>
<p>back home. Ill see my castle. Ill be free</p>
<p>from passion that, since I have met Radyell,</p>
<p>has burned my soul: I can control it well.</p>
<p>Oh, how I want to see my little things!</p>
<p>I cannot wait! O Dragon, spread your wings!    1550</p>
<p>I have become a man more strong and wise.</p>
<p>No womans haunting me. I must arise!</p>
<p>Nobody came. He could not know the reason,</p>
<p>but he believed it was a sign of treason.</p>
<p>My friends, why dont you come? I feel betrayed!</p>
<p>My heart is torn! I wonder why I prayed!</p>
<p>But then he thought that something had befallen.</p>
<p>How can it be? The Dragon must have fallen!</p>
<p>I know them well, too well for me to think</p>
<p>that they dont want to come. My bones do shrink   1560</p>
<p>as I imagine that they wont arrive.</p>
<p>In darkness gushing from my heart I dive!</p>
<p>They cant be dead! Theyre not in Heavens room!</p>
<p>&hellip;And now I suffer deeply for their doom.</p>
<p>My destiny is always full of pain</p>
<p>because of Love and Friendship: life they drain,</p>
<p>but they have made me stronger than before;</p>
<p>inside my core I stand the whole lifes roar.</p>
<p>My sky by night is lit by tears, not stars:</p>
<p>each act of life has left inside its scars.    1570</p>
<p>Im breathing ice, all things in black I paint,</p>
<p>Im weeping stones, Im sweating blood, I faint.</p>
<p>Am I pathetic? Well, Im feeling numb,</p>
<p>but never to my pain I shall succumb.</p>
<p>I simply have to wait, it wont be long,</p>
<p>I must be strong and sing a happy song.</p>
<p>Some person says that ancient days</p>
<p>recalled in mind are sweet,</p>
<p>as fresh as rain that falls from leaves,</p>
<p>they help you in the heat.       1580</p>
<p>Oblivions hands are full of dust,</p>
<p>on which we cannot feed;</p>
<p>the fruits of memory are good,</p>
<p>a thing we always need.</p>
<p>You should remember yesterday,</p>
<p>it is your only certainty:</p>
<p>the past is always on the way,</p>
<p>to live, you need your memories.
I lived in pain, it comes again</p>
<p>and still I suffer so        1590</p>
<p>that I feel cursed: no saints with me,</p>
<p>I dont know where to go.</p>
<p>Some drop of joy, when I was a boy,</p>
<p>is lovely to remind,</p>
<p>but many scenes are horrible:</p>
<p>they should be left behind.</p>
<p>You must remember yesterday,</p>
<p>it is your only certainty;</p>
<p>the past is always on the way,</p>
<p>to think, from it you cant be free.     1600</p>
<p>Even sad memories are good:</p>
<p>they show that we can face</p>
<p>the sufferings that Fortune brings:</p>
<p>we lived through the disgrace.</p>
<p>They give new hope, new force, new life,</p>
<p>without them we cant do:</p>
<p>I want to be with memory,</p>
<p>I hope youre coming too.</p>
<p>We must remember yesterday,</p>
<p>it is the only certainty;       1610</p>
<p>the past is always on the way,</p>
<p>with every one, with you and me.</p>
<p>Its true that of the past we cant get rid:</p>
<p>its something we are forcèd to live with.</p>
<p>Im here, alive, Ive gone through all despair,</p>
<p>but still I dare to face the wind unfair.</p>
<p>Im here, alive, but utterly alone,</p>
<p>like God who rules this world upon His throne,</p>
<p>like Everything, His reign, Totality,</p>
<p>Infinity, what Was and what Will Be:     1620</p>
<p>the sum of all existing things is one,</p>
<p>Im one, alone, like, over there, the Sun.</p>
<p>There is no meaning for the number Two:</p>
<p>this point of view is strange, but can be true.</p>
<p>The others are too distant to be seen,</p>
<p>the eye can see inside and there be keen,</p>
<p>outside theres nothing to be found at all,</p>
<p>thats why my hopes of love had better fall.</p>
<p>Sometimes we try to show our inner parts,</p>
<p>but words and arts cant reach the minds and hearts.   1630</p>
<p>Attempts to show the souls are bound to fail,</p>
<p>like any human gesture: theres no sail</p>
<p>to cross the deepest oceans of mankind,</p>
<p>we always have to leave all hopes behind.</p>
<p>The colours of the light across a prism</p>
<p>are eaten by the black of Pessimism:</p>
<p>then whats life for, if there can be no mirth?</p>
<p>An evil act is, giving children birth!</p>
<p>A single thing is certain: we must die,</p>
<p>they, you and I: theres not a thing to try.    1640</p>
<p>There even might be not a God: the dust</p>
<p>would rule the «lives», and Pleasure, tied with Lust,</p>
<p>would be the only thing worth living for,</p>
<p>but theres no Pleasure for mankind, no more.</p>
<p>What can be good? Lust, money, food, love, art?</p>
<p>Since we are born, all hopes are torn apart.</p>
<p>Im drowning in the gloom of Nothingness,</p>
<p>I soon will die, I cannot bear this stress.</p>
<p>Theres silence in my heart. But&hellip; what I hear?</p>
<p>A voice is clear! I see a light appear!     1650</p>
<p>Its Mother Nature talking to her son!</p>
<p>«My dear, by grief unseen you cant be won!</p>
<p>Why do birds sing? And why do trees still grow?</p>
<p>And four winds blow? And why do rivers flow?</p>
<p>You have the greatest gift: you live! You use</p>
<p>your body, heart and mind, but oh! the blues</p>
<p>are holding you so close to suicide!</p>
<p>Im now your guide, since other hopes have died.</p>
<p>Please listen well: your thought is free to fly,</p>
<p>but youll lose just your body when you die.    1660</p>
<p>Dont think too much bout things so far away!</p>
<p>Remember: stay on earth or you will pay!»</p>
<p>Good mother, youve just saved a human life!</p>
<p>The search of foods the only useful strife!</p>
<p>There was a woman, dressed with leaves all green,</p>
<p>her eyes like sea were blue, she seemed a queen,</p>
<p>her skin was white like clouds, her lips like fire</p>
<p>were red; she spoke: «Whats left of your desire?</p>
<p>You also need a child, wholl follow thee:</p>
<p>you need a woman! Listen, Knight, to me!»     1670</p>
<p>Youre right again, but I must wait: my land</p>
<p>is distant, still I need your helping hand!</p>
<p>You certainly have promises to keep</p>
<p>and miles to go before the fatal sleep,</p>
<p>but, my dear son, my work is done: its you</p>
<p>who had to pay much since the day you flew</p>
<p>down here, in this luxurious, fruitful plain;</p>
<p>I only had to help you win the pain.</p>
<p>I have restored your hope: this was my aim;</p>
<p>you have to claim your kingdom, your old name.    1680</p>
<p>Remember: youre the Last Knight, youre a king!</p>
<p>You have a mission into which to fling!</p>
<p>Good mother, I thank thee: you heal the wound</p>
<p>I had before, when for a girl I moond.</p>
<p>Alas, why have my friends been led astray?</p>
<p>Why dont they come? No longer I must pay!</p>
<p>If only he could see where they were kept!</p>
<p>The women wept, not one of them had slept.</p>
<p>Were going to die in this metallic cage!</p>
<p>These bars can not be broken by my rage.    1690</p>
<p>Were doomed, we cant survive! Shut up and think!</p>
<p>How can we think? We have not slept a wink!</p>
<p>And it is long since we last had a meal!</p>
<p>Were starving and cant dream: this is whats real.</p>
<p>Why dont we take those mushrooms on the wall?</p>
<p>They might be good! Or they may kill us all.</p>
<p>About the mushrooms once I read a book:</p>
<p>I know a bit, so let me take a look.</p>
<p>Some looked at them: their colours were so bright;</p>
<p>with feeble light they gleamed in that deep night.   1700</p>
<p>The sun had just set down and other stars</p>
<p>came out and shone beyond the window bars;</p>
<p>inside the mushrooms, green and yellow, shone:</p>
<p>they showed themselves upon the wall of stone.</p>
<p>Another light awoke inside one brain:</p>
<p>Weve got the key! No longer well remain!</p>
<p>All voices muttered with a great surprise:</p>
<p>What do you mean?! What do you say?! Not lies!</p>
<p>Ive heard about those fungi: they make spores</p>
<p>that dissolve steel, the metal of these doors!    1710</p>
<p>Youre right: these acid mushrooms cant be eaten,</p>
<p>but, with their strength, the doors can down be beaten!</p>
<p>It seemed to them that night was not so dark.</p>
<p>To make them work, we also need a spark.</p>
<p>We need a source of intense energy</p>
<p>or they wont start their work to set us free.</p>
<p>I know the stones: we might find some good ones</p>
<p>that work like flint and steel. Get them at once!</p>
<p>Well, this is not as easy as it seems:</p>
<p>these stone are rare and&hellip; Please dont kill our dreams!  1720</p>
<p>With all these words, the chords of Hope you touch!</p>
<p>Im still afraid that I can not do much,</p>
<p>but I must try to play the symphony</p>
<p>of joy inside your hearts that must break free.</p>
<p>As one picked up the fungi, thother searched:</p>
<p>as he found nothing first, his senses lurched,</p>
<p>then he found that he had a steely belt</p>
<p>and, trying again, a piece of flint he felt.</p>
<p>I have the stone and steel! This is good news!</p>
<p>We soon wont any longer be recluse!     1730</p>
<p>&hellip;Dear reader, is this happening too fast?</p>
<p>This tale is coming from an ancient past:</p>
<p>nobody knows the Truth, because the ages</p>
<p>have blown it far away from these good pages.</p>
<p>It is not Truth, but Beauty what I follow:</p>
<p>did I not so, these pages would be hollow.</p>
<p>I needed to invent some stratagem,</p>
<p>a tiny, useful lie, to set free them.</p>
<p>Please look beyond the single facts I tell:</p>
<p>a higher story lies inside this shell.     1740</p>
<p>I ask you to suspend your disbelief;</p>
<p>but I go back, as silent as a thief,</p>
<p>to tell the small events, report the speeches</p>
<p>and see those distant lands that my soul reaches.</p>
<p>&hellip;And please forgive the fact that I dont use</p>
<p>the name of those who act: my lonesome Muse</p>
<p>just tells me what is happening, but not</p>
<p>the one who speaks or does expand the plot.</p>
<p>I wonder why she does it; well, it seems</p>
<p>to me that this is similar to dreams.     1750</p>
<p>Except some case, and you can find them well,</p>
<p>the will to use the name I always quell:</p>
<p>this is a way to make you think that all</p>
<p>the characters can do what doth befall,</p>
<p>or say the words that sink inside your eyes</p>
<p>and thence can touch your inner chords and rise.</p>
<p>This may be seen as real equality;</p>
<p>but lets return to facts, eventually!</p>
<p>The mushrooms, better: fungi, were prepared;</p>
<p>they were excited and their hopes they shared.    1760</p>
<p>Take this! Help me remove this piece of steel!</p>
<p>We are to spread the sails of Freedoms keel!</p>
<p>To keep this firm, I need that piece of wood!</p>
<p>I have good hands! As any woman should!</p>
<p>How can I do? Its not within my ken!</p>
<p>A lot of words like these were wasted then.</p>
<p>Lets try again! Oh, wait! We have a torch!</p>
<p>Quick, take it here, before your hand you scorch!</p>
<p>They managed to illuminate the room:</p>
<p>this broke the darkness and their inner gloom.    1770</p>
<p>Are we all sure of this? I still feel loth.</p>
<p>Come on, my friend, its not the time for sloth!</p>
<p>Give me a spark! There is no need of fire!</p>
<p>Were going to fly, like birds that in the sky are!</p>
<p>A saint took pity on my soul! The boulder,</p>
<p>the cross I had, is taken off my shoulder!</p>
<p>We have some skil and knowledge built at school</p>
<p>and, with this tool, that tyrant we can fool!</p>
<p>It works! It works! We are deliverèd!</p>
<p>I cry! Why do you cry? I laugh instead!    1780</p>
<p>We have fulfilled a dream! Be silent, hush!</p>
<p>Mayhap there is a guard that hears! Out rush!
Part VII  The Path to Freedom</p>
<p>They left the cell and its bad smell without</p>
<p>a voice or sound; they trod a ground still stout,</p>
<p>but they were free again, like me and you.</p>
<p>And now, my mates? I dont know what to do!</p>
<p>I either dont: this is a perfect riddle!</p>
<p>Well, of a corridor were in the middle!</p>
<p>You think that we should move, dont you think so?</p>
<p>This cannot certainly be cause of woe!     1790</p>
<p>Let not a doubt disturb this good sensation:</p>
<p>I taste the fruit of freedom I cant ration.</p>
<p>Then, bard, your words were true: one day you said</p>
<p>that by the fruit of freedom we are fed,</p>
<p>and that we feel the taste reveal when we</p>
<p>break chains and ties; now, dead the cries, were free.</p>
<p>Youre right. This moment sweeps the times of grey.</p>
<p>I think Id play what words will never say.</p>
<p>Its not the time for Music or Poesy:</p>
<p>its time to think, and quick, what do should we!   1800</p>
<p>We must enthrone the Knight again and kill</p>
<p>the tyrant named Hafald: this is my will.</p>
<p>Youre partly right: that man should not be slain,</p>
<p>he ought to feel the sum of all our pain.</p>
<p>We must restore the legal royal signs</p>
<p>and send to prison whos outside the lines.</p>
<p>Yet theres a fascination in that man</p>
<p>I cant explain, some thing beyond my ken.</p>
<p>Like any rebel, he doth have a charm:</p>
<p>you feel him as he cant do any harm,     1810</p>
<p>you feel his strength, his power, his appeal,</p>
<p>you feel him as a kind of saviour, real.</p>
<p>We know that his success on sand is built.</p>
<p>He thinks that there should be no sense of guilt,</p>
<p>he says that his own human laws are good,</p>
<p>he pays his wishes, following his mood.</p>
<p>He does not know that impulses can lie:</p>
<p>just think of when you want a man to die.</p>
<p>The force of reason must mediate desires,</p>
<p>pour icy water on the hottest fires.     1820</p>
<p>But not alone should reason be the guide,</p>
<p>for theres a shade that cometh: it doth stride</p>
<p>and it is known as Death, to Life opposed.</p>
<p>To flee from it, we cannot keep hearts closed,</p>
<p>lest wed annihilate the human pleasure</p>
<p>we can enjoy within the correct measure.</p>
<p>Theres something good that can be seized on earth,</p>
<p>when were alive: this light is known as Mirth.</p>
<p>Stop speaking, we must move at once from here!</p>
<p>Where do we have to go? This is not clear!    1830</p>
<p>I think that we should find the beast of gold,</p>
<p>the Dragon: this in future I behold.</p>
<p>We have to take the King Last Knight back home</p>
<p>and let his gold destroy the tyrants chrome.</p>
<p>These metals look the same, they both are yellow,</p>
<p>but just the former one is rich and mellow.</p>
<p>The Dragon must be held in places safe!</p>
<p>He cant be tied by chains: just let him chafe!</p>
<p>He certainly is strong: his strength we need</p>
<p>to sow the seed of God, the saving creed.     1840</p>
<p>Without a God whose law and light is guide,</p>
<p>thered be no shelter under which to hide,</p>
<p>no time, no place where human race could grow,</p>
<p>no certainty, no way to be wed know.</p>
<p>This speech is going to distant lands, forlorn,</p>
<p>unknown to Man: now stop, or thee Ill scorn.</p>
<p>Youre right: my ignorance is still too great,</p>
<p>tis not the time to open a debate.</p>
<p>Then let us go outside these mourning halls!</p>
<p>These bars and walls still whisper sombre calls.   1850</p>
<p>They moved as silent as the growing grass</p>
<p>and, one by one, the doors they found did pass.</p>
<p>As underground they were, they met a staircase:</p>
<p>a step still dry on it was such a rare case</p>
<p>that one by one they walkèd, in a row:</p>
<p>and thus they came from those bad walls below.</p>
<p>Now that weve left the prisons, what is next?</p>
<p>By some deep sense of lost they still were vexed.</p>
<p>How much Id pay to find a way that leads</p>
<p>outside! I shed my tears of lead: these beads    1860</p>
<p>are cutting deep my face, that sleep so needs.</p>
<p>As I live still, I must fulfil my deeds,</p>
<p>but nothing in this castle can be done:</p>
<p>we have to leave from here and we must run!</p>
<p>We must go here, we must go there,</p>
<p>we need some fresh new air,</p>
<p>one time again we have to dare.</p>
<p>We need the Dragon, great,</p>
<p>to find the Last Knight ere it is too late,</p>
<p>to cross the sky, blue gate.       1870
Alone, alone, hes all alone</p>
<p>and stolen is his throne,</p>
<p>but were in panic and we moan.</p>
<p>Uncertainty we feel:</p>
<p>we all felt free, but this is not yet real;</p>
<p>lets move without a reel!</p>
<p>We need the help of one good man:</p>
<p>weve left the frying pan,</p>
<p>into the fire we cant sink again!</p>
<p>We need a spy, a guide,        1880</p>
<p>a man to trust in, on the correct side,</p>
<p>in whom does Law abide.</p>
<p>I think we need the help of old Asthore,</p>
<p>who ought to have the key of every door.</p>
<p>Of course! Asthore! A loyal servant, he!</p>
<p>I bet he knows a perfect way to flee!</p>
<p>And he can tell us what has happened since</p>
<p>we were imprisoned by that false, black prince.</p>
<p>I mean Hafald, whos Evil turned to flesh,</p>
<p>whose demon army is prepared to clash     1890</p>
<p>against the Last Knight, who shall fight this Hell,</p>
<p>this false dominion, made by He who fell.</p>
<p>Black blood shall slowly flow in sinuous rills,</p>
<p>when they are met upon the Fatal Hills;</p>
<p>and when we see the signs of Victory,</p>
<p>then Peace shall be throughout the land and sea.</p>
<p>You are exalting him a bit, arent you?</p>
<p>What do you mean? I simply say whats true!</p>
<p>The Knight is strong and pure and he can win</p>
<p>the man who brought on Earth the age of sin.    1900</p>
<p>He seems the Saviour, in your mighty word!</p>
<p>Hes just a Knight, a servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>His deeds shall show the Law, not what he says;</p>
<p>he shall avenge the horror of those days</p>
<p>when we were kept unjustly in a prison;</p>
<p>we sufferd as the saints, but for no reason.</p>
<p>Hell show the power of a moral mortal,</p>
<p>who, with his pain, of Hell had passed the portal.</p>
<p>And men shall sing of him who did escape</p>
<p>and left his power to a shrieking ape,     1910</p>
<p>of how he found that he had made an error,</p>
<p>to expiate with many weeks of terror,</p>
<p>and of his triumphal return as King:</p>
<p>the Knight shall rule again, this men shall sing.</p>
<p>This parts not written yet, but soon shall be:</p>
<p>lets try to turn it to reality!</p>
<p>They knew where good Asthore was; there they went</p>
<p>and found him, who the castle better kent.</p>
<p>Asthore, astonished, could not realise</p>
<p>what that could mean: they were a big surprise.    1920</p>
<p>What do the masters want from me, I ask?</p>
<p>What can I offer? Empty is my flask!</p>
<p>We need the help of thine to leave this place:</p>
<p>you know it as the wrinkles on your face.</p>
<p>They need the help of mine! What can be done?</p>
<p>There is the Darkness, covering the Sun:</p>
<p>this is the help they need. What can I give?</p>
<p>A man that showeth them a way to leave.</p>
<p>Whats known by thee about the beast that flies?</p>
<p>They mean the Dragon? Hear I do his cries.    1930</p>
<p>He suffereth, for hes imprisonèd.</p>
<p>Out of my window let your sight be led.</p>
<p>They lookèd down and there the beast did sleep.</p>
<p>Hes not the kind of thing that chains can keep,</p>
<p>but he hath not yet wanted to break loose:</p>
<p>it seemeth that his hope the beast did lose.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make ourselves get down?</p>
<p>The others at the man who spoke did frown.</p>
<p>I hope I have not heard a crazy man!</p>
<p>Why dont we try? It is a perfect plan!     1940</p>
<p>But tell me how you think to climb the wall!</p>
<p>We have no rope, or any thing at all!</p>
<p>Theres some upon that shelf, but its too short:</p>
<p>we have no way to leave this stolen court!</p>
<p>In that same time, the Dragon heard them speak.</p>
<p>Is this the voice of those whose heart is meek?</p>
<p>It seemeth not my torturer, not him</p>
<p>who gives me grief, but oh! the voice is dim&hellip;</p>
<p>His eye he opened and he took a glance:</p>
<p>the night was cold, a heavy wind did dance,    1950</p>
<p>but, coming from a window, he could see</p>
<p>a light and hear a voice that gave him glee.</p>
<p>It must be them, the noblemen, the friends</p>
<p>of the Last Knight, the King who all defends!</p>
<p>The nobles heard this mutter from afar</p>
<p>and spoke loud: Dragon, say, awake you are?</p>
<p>I am! I cant believe its really you!</p>
<p>You make me happy, after days of rue!</p>
<p>We must take back the King upon his throne!</p>
<p>We need your help to find the Knight, alone.    1960</p>
<p>Their voices sounded loud throughout the air:</p>
<p>they made some men awake from dreams so fair.</p>
<p>As long as they were confusèd by sleep,</p>
<p>they had to creep and on the Dragon leap.</p>
<p>Arise you Dragon! Let your potent wings</p>
<p>be no more held by heavy, rusty strings!</p>
<p>And harken: soon will come the men with bows,</p>
<p>we must escape before the red blood flows!</p>
<p>There were the noises of a coming war:</p>
<p>the sound of feet all tramping on the floor,    1970</p>
<p>the sound of weapons, gradually more loud.</p>
<p>Be quick! We cannot face the armèd crowd!</p>
<p>These vincula, these gyves, shall soon be broken.</p>
<p>We are to see again the golden token,</p>
<p>the symbol of the King since days of yore.</p>
<p>The flag, now lowerd, spoilt has been by gore,</p>
<p>for its defenders have encounterèd</p>
<p>a pain and grief unknown, or now are dead;</p>
<p>but it shall come again beneath the clouds,</p>
<p>that shall be white again, not black like shrouds.   1980</p>
<p>The Dragon felt his blood begin to boil:</p>
<p>his heavy feet well planted on the soil,</p>
<p>he gatherèd his rage: he blasted flames</p>
<p>that melted up his chains. The blocks he maims!</p>
<p>The morbid, sombre arms that did entwine</p>
<p>the Dragon have been cut by flames that shine!</p>
<p>Climb down the window, quick! We cannot stay!</p>
<p>We cannot lose this chance to go away!</p>
<p>The Dragon lifted up; upon his back</p>
<p>the eighteen fell; no archer did attack.     1990</p>
<p>All right, lets go! No, wait! We need a thing:</p>
<p>the Holy Sword, the weapon of the King!</p>
<p>Oh, no! I am afraid that you are right!</p>
<p>It is as if we given had our plight.</p>
<p>A Knight, a King without his sword is bare:</p>
<p>it must be taken from the tyrants lair.</p>
<p>Inside the throne room still it ought to be!</p>
<p>Then lets go there: we have to set it free!</p>
<p>Surprise is what we have, our only card:</p>
<p>we have to play it ere they take their guard.    2000</p>
<p>The Dragon, with that burden, flied so slow</p>
<p>that fear and tension in their hearts did grow.</p>
<p>Be quick! We have to reach the window, big,</p>
<p>up there or we should start our graves to dig!</p>
<p>Youre heavy, men and women! Youre not mice!</p>
<p>So please shut up: dont make me say it twice!</p>
<p>Those moments lasted years because the tension</p>
<p>inside their veins expanded that dimension.</p>
<p>Each beat of wings was like an agony;</p>
<p>the air was cold much more than it could be;    2010</p>
<p>the thoughts and memories of many years</p>
<p>condensèd in their souls and turnd to fears.</p>
<p>The meaning of Existence they were finding:</p>
<p>its like a road thats narrow, steep and winding,</p>
<p>the what I wish against the what I can,</p>
<p>the Duty and the Pleasure of a man</p>
<p>that always fight and seldom come to peace:</p>
<p>when this befalls, of Heaven theres a piece.</p>
<p>They were upon the edge of the abyss:</p>
<p>by doves or ravens would they get a kiss?     2020</p>
<p>Not mouth, but heavy claws the Dragon laid</p>
<p>upon the crystal window highly paid.</p>
<p>The windows gone: we need a volunteer</p>
<p>to slide down, take the Sword and come back here.</p>
<p>I am the closest one: to try I claim!</p>
<p>But youre a dame! This would be cause of shame!</p>
<p>Shes right. I deem that she should try to go.</p>
<p>Be realistic and dont answer «No».</p>
<p>And whats the shame if she is not a male?</p>
<p>You think that she is weak and thus shall fail!?   2030</p>
<p>But Courtesy compels a man to risk</p>
<p>his life instead of hers, although shes brisk.</p>
<p>The Courtesy of you is really grand,</p>
<p>but understand that shes the saving hand:</p>
<p>she can slide down the wing, find out the Sword</p>
<p>and come back here with it before the horde</p>
<p>of enemies arrives with its crossbows</p>
<p>and shoots at us. The sand of time still flows</p>
<p>so quickly that we cannot waste our time:</p>
<p>do what you must do now, it is no crime!     2040</p>
<p>Like cats agile, the girl fragile seemed not.</p>
<p>She leapt along the wing as if twas hot,</p>
<p>went through the window and, to her surprise,</p>
<p>found no one there. Where do you think it lies?</p>
<p>It should be not so distant from the throne&hellip;</p>
<p>Hung to the wall it was: it stood alone.</p>
<p>Its here! I deem that it doth gleam a light.</p>
<p>Tis strange to view: is it due to its might?</p>
<p>Its power must be very great, indeed.</p>
<p>Shut up! Come here or, wounded, soon well bleed.   2050</p>
<p>All right, I come. She took it: it was warm.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it took another form:</p>
<p>it was a wind that put her on her seat.</p>
<p>My comrades, I suggest a quick retreat!</p>
<p>The wind returned to be the Holy Sword.</p>
<p>The Dragon moved, but then they heard a word:</p>
<p>Attack! A thousand darts and arrows fled</p>
<p>and blood began to fall in drops of red.</p>
<p>The Dragon has been hit! Alas! Please, fly!</p>
<p>I must: I will do it, until I die.     2060</p>
<p>Unless the darts all hit: you need a shell.</p>
<p>They heard a sound like tolling of a bell:</p>
<p>a lightning cut the blue sky like a blade,</p>
<p>its shininess did clear the Dragons shade,</p>
<p>and then from Heaven they did hear a call:</p>
<p>The Holy Sword, the Sword of Miracle,</p>
<p>shall be your shield and weapon: you wont die,</p>
<p>I, Gabriel, do lead you from the sky.</p>
<p>The Holy Sword became a shield of steel:</p>
<p>a sense of immense power they did feel.     2070</p>
<p>We need not fear, an Angels by our side;</p>
<p>and now lets ride the sky, we cant abide!</p>
<p>The clouds did break, a mighty wind did blow;</p>
<p>they were a sail, a stream of air did flow.</p>
<p>The Hope, from feeble as the webs of spiders,</p>
<p>was growing stronger in the eighteen riders.</p>
<p>They had a Guide, who saw them from afar,</p>
<p>beyond the signs of Man and every star:</p>
<p>they did not know that, little time ahead,</p>
<p>without this guiding they would all be dead.    2080</p>
<p>They flied across the clouds as fast as sound,</p>
<p>they could not even see down there the ground;</p>
<p>they flied across the night beneath stars scary;</p>
<p>at their arrival, they were all weary.
Part VIII  The Final Triumph</p>
<p>The Knight had spent those days without a rest,</p>
<p>awake all days till then when, from the west,</p>
<p>he saw the Dragon great materialising,</p>
<p>completed by the Sun that then was rising.</p>
<p>Symmetrically perfect was that scene:</p>
<p>two mighty lights together could be seen.     2090</p>
<p>The Knight did feel this power in the air</p>
<p>by breathing, he could sense it everywhere.</p>
<p>Like from chrysalides come butterflies,</p>
<p>from ugly things come wonders of the skies,</p>
<p>in all his might the King Last Knight arose.</p>
<p>He screamed to his companions coming close:</p>
<p>This morning washes all my pain away.</p>
<p>Two Suns I see: this is a glorious day!</p>
<p>He jumped around. He seemed a bit insane,</p>
<p>but that exalting joy who could contain?     2100</p>
<p>His time had come to leave that lonesome place,</p>
<p>go home again and save the human race.</p>
<p>He heard inside the sound of violins,</p>
<p>of harps, of bells and flutes, playing merry dins.</p>
<p>We have with us the Holy Sword for you!</p>
<p>I felt its presence. Can you feel it, too?</p>
<p>Theres something magic in the air today,</p>
<p>I feel Im watched by something I cant say&hellip;</p>
<p>Theres Gabriel who watches from above!</p>
<p>Of an Archangel I can feel the Love!     2110</p>
<p>I think that something unbelievable,</p>
<p>like mighty facts of legends, shall befall!</p>
<p>&hellip;But we are wasting time! I have a mission:</p>
<p>I must compel Hafald to yield demission!</p>
<p>He cant stay any longer on my seat,</p>
<p>my throne: he is the man I must defeat.</p>
<p>With you, my friends, forever by my side,</p>
<p>I shall return as King; I must not hide.</p>
<p>I have become a wiser man and sadder.</p>
<p>I want to ride with you. Send down a ladder!    2120</p>
<p>The Holy Sword shall turn into a rope:</p>
<p>you should not grope, but stride, at least I hope.</p>
<p>The Sword had no mutation. Come on, change!</p>
<p>It does not seem to work: this is so strange.</p>
<p>Disaster is impending: I can taste</p>
<p>it in the wind. Get down, good Dragon, haste!</p>
<p>Indeed this was the truth: the sky went dark</p>
<p>completely, of the Sun they saw no mark,</p>
<p>and then appeared an army from afar.</p>
<p>A voice did crumble: This is where you are!    2130</p>
<p>Hafald! This is your voice! Whats happening?</p>
<p>Some blood was dripping from the Dragons wing:</p>
<p>it showed the road that easily has led</p>
<p>me and my army here. You are all dead!</p>
<p>Theres nothing written yet! I can destroy</p>
<p>your army without flinching, silly boy!</p>
<p>Give me the Holy Sword! His hands did seize</p>
<p>the hilt; the blade was lifted; fresh, a breeze</p>
<p>did blow upon his face: This is a sign</p>
<p>that Gods with me: the Victory is mine!     2140</p>
<p>The Knight ran to the army still approaching.</p>
<p>The heavy ground he trod was slowly poaching,</p>
<p>it was as if the Angel built a road</p>
<p>to let him run, and it was growing broad.</p>
<p>A halo of pure light enfolded him:</p>
<p>he dived into the army and did swim.</p>
<p>The Holy Sword and him were just one thing:</p>
<p>they mowed the foemen all where he did fling.</p>
<p>The noblemen themselves were in a sphere</p>
<p>of light, like the Last Knight: they had no fear.   2150</p>
<p>Hafald could not be seen, but just be heard.</p>
<p>There came a crow, an evil-telling bird;</p>
<p>Hafalds voice came from it, as dark and deep</p>
<p>as black volcanoes whence doth lava creep:</p>
<p>I summon thee, the Angel First who fell;</p>
<p>I worship thee, unlock the Gates of Hell!</p>
<p>The wind became a gust of smoke and sand</p>
<p>as hot as Hell: the storm did scorch the land.</p>
<p>The Earth began to quake: it crackd, it growld,</p>
<p>it roard, it howld, it moand as if it prowld.   2160</p>
<p>The wounded planet bled and from below</p>
<p>the shrieks of demons came; then fell a snow</p>
<p>not white, but black, that burnt the men Hafald</p>
<p>had brought with him. The Knight, who could behold</p>
<p>these poor men, suffering entirely,</p>
<p>killed them, as only Death could set them free.</p>
<p>Then slowly came the demons from the holes:</p>
<p>black things, not humans, made of hate and doles.</p>
<p>One came from down the nobles; luckily,</p>
<p>the globe of light was safe. They just could see   2170</p>
<p>the Knight that kept on fighting like before:</p>
<p>the demons, though more tough, did live no more.</p>
<p>The demons keep emerging from the chasms!</p>
<p>The Knight needs help or hell be killed by spasms!</p>
<p>In my opinion we should kill the crow!</p>
<p>It is the one who summons from below</p>
<p>the demons, it has opened Hells big door,</p>
<p>it makes the tides come furious on the shore.</p>
<p>We ought to kill the source of evil things,</p>
<p>arising from the land where no bird sings.    2180</p>
<p>They managed to pick up a piece of rock.</p>
<p>Go, stone, and give the bird a fatal shock!</p>
<p>The crow was unaware of what theyd said:</p>
<p>it could not see the stone that split its head.</p>
<p>No one averrd theyd killd a bird of God:</p>
<p>tis right to slay the birds if they seek blood.</p>
<p>It cried, it screamed, it roared, it seemed the Beast,</p>
<p>the Devil, or the Oceans roar at least.</p>
<p>The demons screamed with it, the ground did shake</p>
<p>as agonising once again: the stake      2190</p>
<p>was won, they had defeated it who made</p>
<p>the demons rise, they stopped the black parade.</p>
<p>What have you done, my friends? Weve killed the bird</p>
<p>that was Hafald! Then Victory Ive heard!</p>
<p>These sounds, horrific, herald the defeat</p>
<p>of Hell! So now the demons must retreat!</p>
<p>The sordid, viscid things of black were leaving.</p>
<p>I want them all, I cannot keep them living!</p>
<p>O Sword, become a rope and take me down!</p>
<p>I have the force to steal the Devils crown!    2200</p>
<p>Remember: close the doors of Hell, before</p>
<p>another army comes that seeks for gore!</p>
<p>The Devil might send up some other fiend!</p>
<p>You have to stop this mad satanic wind!</p>
<p>Of course! They might feel close to win, not fail!</p>
<p>You have to stop the Devils thrashing flail!</p>
<p>A bursting voice did scream a dark command</p>
<p>with sentences no one could understand,</p>
<p>but it did seem a sign that fed their fear:</p>
<p>the demons still alive did stop. Its clear,    2210</p>
<p>were right! The Knight killed them, then he did enter</p>
<p>a crack that led down to of Earth the centre.</p>
<p>The sword did turn into a heavy rope.</p>
<p>The Knight began to leap along a slope.</p>
<p>The Holy Sword is certainly a key!</p>
<p>The Knight went fast, no more they him could see.</p>
<p>The rope was strongly tied and growing tense,</p>
<p>but it was firm and tough, a good defence</p>
<p>against the force of gravity, attracting</p>
<p>the Knight towards a Hell that still was acting.   2220</p>
<p>A snap: the rope was torn! Oh, no! He fell!</p>
<p>It cant be so! Wed hear a mourning bell!</p>
<p>From down below a feeble light did glow.</p>
<p>Are you alive? They heard his answer: No!</p>
<p>Good Heavens! We were thinking you as dead!</p>
<p>You know, from here we saw the broken tread&hellip;</p>
<p>I cannot die, not now! The end is near!</p>
<p>Im close to clear the Evil and the Fear!</p>
<p>The Devil is so strong, but I can win</p>
<p>and from this world I might exile the Sin!    2230</p>
<p>If Victorys not mine, well see the reign</p>
<p>of Hell, that means in Life eternal Pain.</p>
<p>Now let me plunge into the depths of Earth,</p>
<p>just like the water flows into a firth.</p>
<p>The scenery is horrible indeed,</p>
<p>I must resist and stop the cursèd breed.</p>
<p>He ran across a corridor of stones</p>
<p>with angles sharp that tried to break his bones.</p>
<p>The rope had turned into the Sword again:</p>
<p>it gave protection like a talisman.      2240</p>
<p>Without it, hed be burnt by all the heat.</p>
<p>A vivid red, the colour he did meet,</p>
<p>was even in the air because of ashes</p>
<p>that gleamed, like evil tiny eyes, with flashes.</p>
<p>The narrow tunnel seemed to have no end.</p>
<p>Around, the rocks did scream sounds that offend.</p>
<p>Sweat fell upon his brow like grains of hail,</p>
<p>his face was pale, no breath he did exhale.</p>
<p>The magic halo wrapping him did melt</p>
<p>the rocks that closing were, and safe he felt.    2250</p>
<p>I have the Holy Sword, I have the skill</p>
<p>and Gods with me: the mission Ill fulfil.</p>
<p>He entered wide a hole; there was the Door,</p>
<p>engraved with shapes that my mind cant explore:</p>
<p>they were imbued with terror, pain and sorrow.</p>
<p>Im here! Lucifers plan has no tomorrow!</p>
<p>He gatherd up his strengths to win the strain</p>
<p>and close the door that leads to Hell, the reign</p>
<p>where humans without Moral lose the Soul,</p>
<p>the ones who their obsessions cant control.    2260</p>
<p>A snake came quickly out and bit his arm!</p>
<p>He bleeded! Satan was the cause of harm:</p>
<p>the snake who Eve seduced had bitten him;</p>
<p>he grasped and threw it, but his eyes went dim.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes; forgetting his sensation,</p>
<p>he pulled the door beyond which is Damnation.</p>
<p>A voice of utter rage did scream his name.</p>
<p>Return to your eternal burning flame!</p>
<p>He could not bear all this and long he cried,</p>
<p>then took a glance&hellip; and found himself outside.   2270</p>
<p>Im&hellip; shedding tears! This soil theyll irrigate.</p>
<p>Now be the triumph: happiness cant wait!</p>
<p>You right are: I have nothing to atone,</p>
<p>I must go home and fill my empty throne!</p>
<p>The dragon, tired, found in happiness</p>
<p>the force to make the flight back home, I guess.</p>
<p>The citizens saw them still far away:</p>
<p>The King returns! Be this a merry day!</p>
<p>In glorious pump, by petals of the roses</p>
<p>they were saluted: all pulled up their noses    2280</p>
<p>to see the splendid Dragon land before</p>
<p>the castle, and We live just for your core!</p>
<p>the people said. I thank you. I feel weak,</p>
<p>but I declare to celebrate one week!</p>
<p>Be there just joy and feasts! This is my house!</p>
<p>One day Ill be completed by a spouse,</p>
<p>but Im alone no longer! Thanks to you!</p>
<p>The feastful seven nights and days, they flew,</p>
<p>and in the morning of the seventh day</p>
<p>the Knight had disappeared. Hes gone away!    2290</p>
<p>Impossible! He cant have gone so far!</p>
<p>A legend says that he might be a star&hellip;</p>
<p>His Fates some where in time, some when in space,</p>
<p>not here, not now: no more is this his place.</p>
<p>Hes gone, hes left this world: he cannot rest,</p>
<p>hes needed elsewhere, hes the Knight, the Last.</p>
<p>So arid is the vein of my invention</p>
<p>that now the time has come to leave this mansion;</p>
<p>but something still is moving by the gate</p>
<p>that leads to this mysterious world that rends    2300</p>
<p>asunder: theres a figure, someone great,</p>
<p>it is the King Last Knight! He understands</p>
<p>that he must leave to face elsewhere his fate,</p>
<p>but hell be back: the story never ends.     (2304)</p>
