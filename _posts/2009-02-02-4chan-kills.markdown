[Pekka-Eric Auvinen][1]: **Humanity is overrated**.  
  
> His photo and **a message that he would "kill people at jokela high school today in the name of anonymous" was posted on the image board [4chan][2]** the same day. It however has been stated by the Finnish police that they could not find a connection between Auvinen and "Anonymous".
