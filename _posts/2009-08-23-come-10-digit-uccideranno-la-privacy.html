Se riflettiamo un secondo Ã¨ effettivamente vero che 10-digit di informazioni non sono veramente un traguardo irraggiungibile ma anzi...  
  
> Internet denizens and urban dwellers alike need to recognize that an era of anonymity is ending.  
> The population of the world stands at about 7 billion. So it takes only 10 digits to label each human being on the planet uniquely.
> This simple arithmetic observation offers powerful insight into the limits of privacy. It dictates something we might call the 10-Digit Rule: just 10 digits or so of distinctive personal information are enough to identify you uniquely. They're enough to strip away your anonymity on the Internet or call out your name as you walk down the street. The 10-Digit Rule means that as our electronic gadgets grow chattier, and databases swell, we must accept that in most walks of life, we'll soon be wearing our names on our foreheads.
